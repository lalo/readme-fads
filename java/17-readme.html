<p><strong>Please note that the master branch is currently the development branch for Vert.x 3.0. For Vert.x 2, please see the 2.x branch</strong></p>

<p>Vert.x is a polyglot, non-blocking, event-driven application platform that runs on the JVM.</p>

<p>Some of the key highlights include:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><p>Polyglot. You can write your application components in JavaScript, Ruby, Groovy, Java or Python, and you can mix and match several programming languages in a single application.</p></li>
<li><p>Simple <em>actor-like</em> concurrency model. Vert.x allows you to write all your code as single threaded, freeing you from many of the pitfalls of multi-threaded programming. (No more <code>synchronized</code>, <code>volatile</code> or explicit locking).</p></li>
<li><p>Vert.x takes advantage of the JVM and scales seamlessly over available cores without having to manually fork multiple servers and handle inter process communication between them.</p></li>
<li><p>Vert.x has a simple, asynchronous programming model for writing scalable non-blocking applications that can scale to 10s, 100s or even millions of concurrent connections using a minimal number of operating system threads.</p></li>
<li><p>Vert.x includes a distributed event bus that spans the client and server side so your applications components can communicate easily. The event bus even penetrates into in-browser JavaScript allowing you to create effortless so-called <em>real-time</em> web applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Vert.x provides real power and simplicity, without being simplistic. Configuration and boiler-plate is kept to a minimum.</p></li>
<li><p>Vert.x includes a powerful module system and public module registry, so you can easily re-use and share Vert.x modules with others.</p></li>
<li><p>Vert.x can be embedded in your existing Java applications.</p></li>
