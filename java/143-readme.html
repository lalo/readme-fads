<div class="announce instapaper_body markdown" data-path="README.markdown" id="readme"><article class="markdown-body entry-content" itemprop="mainContentOfPage"><p>Welcome to the source code for original editions of <em>The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development</em>!</p>

<p><strong>Note that this book has been substantially revised, with its samples moved to a fresh
GitHub repository, and so if you are looking for more up-to-date
material, you probably want <a href="http://github.com/commonsguy/cw-omnibus">the cw-omnibus repo</a>.</strong></p>

<p>All of the source code in this archive is licensed under the
Apache 2.0 license except as noted.</p>

<p>The names of the top-level directories roughly correspond to a
shortened form of the chapter titles. Since chapter numbers
change with every release, and since some samples are used by
multiple chapters, I am loathe to put chapter numbers in the
actual directory names.</p>

<p>If you wish to use this code, bear in mind a few things:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><p>The projects are set up to be built by Ant, not by Eclipse.
If you wish to use the code with Eclipse, you will need to
create a suitable Android Eclipse project and import the
code and other assets.</p></li>
<li><p>You should delete build.xml from the project, then run
<code>android update project -p ...</code>  (where ... is the path to a project of interest)
  on those projects you wish to use, so the build files are
  updated for your Android SDK version.</p></li>
</ul></article></div>
