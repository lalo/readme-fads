<p>Google I/O is a developer conference held each year with two days of deep
technical content featuring technical sessions and hundreds of demonstrations
from developers showcasing their technologies.</p>

<p>This project is the Android app for the conference. The app supports devices
running Android 4.0+, and is optimized for phones and tablets of all shapes
and sizes. It also contains an Android Wear integration.</p>
