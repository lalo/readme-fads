<a name="user-content-the-new-showcaseview-v50" class="anchor" href="#the-new-showcaseview-v50" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The new ShowcaseView (v5.0)</h1>

<p>This library has become more popular than I ever intended - but at the same time more unwieldy.
This version is intended to be more stable,
more friendly and better tested.</p>

<p>There <strong>are</strong> features missing compared to v4. If you'd like to keep using them, then use the <strong>legacy</strong> branch in this repository. Please see the bottom of this page for more information.</p>

<h1>
<a name="user-content-showcaseview-library" class="anchor" href="#showcaseview-library" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ShowcaseView library</h1>

<p>The ShowcaseView library is designed to highlight and showcase specific parts of apps to the user with a distinctive and attractive overlay. This library is great for pointing out points of interest for users, gestures, or obscure but useful items.</p>

<p>The library is based on the "Cling" view found in the Launcher on Ice-Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean, but extended to be easier to use.</p>

<p>Please check out <a href="http://amlcurran.github.io/ShowcaseView/">the website</a> for more information.</p>

<a name="user-content-set-up" class="anchor" href="#set-up" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Set-up</h2>

<p>The library is now only compatible with Gradle out of the box. To use this library in your project, either:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Add the dependency from Maven like so: <code>compile 'com.github.amlcurran.showcaseview:library:5.0.0'</code>. You'll also need to add Maven central to your <code>repositories {}</code> tag like so:</li>
</ul><pre><code>repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
</code></pre>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Copy the library project into your Gradle project. In your settings.gradle, add the project (using the <code>include (':libary')</code> notation). Sync Gradle and then go ahead! </li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="user-content-is-it-worth-using" class="anchor" href="#is-it-worth-using" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Is it worth using?</h2>

<p>Perhaps. Why not ask 
<a href="https://github.com/googlecast/CastVideos-android">Google</a>,
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mots.haxsync">HaxSync</a>, or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.cast">AllCast</a>, which each use the library?</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>To use ShowcaseView, use the Builder pattern.</p>

<p>As an example:</p>

<pre><code>new ShowcaseView.Builder(this)
    .setTarget(new ActionViewTarget(this, ActionViewTarget.Type.HOME))
    .setContentTitle("ShowcaseView")
    .setContentText("This is highlighting the Home button")
    .hideOnTouchOutside()
    .build();
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-whats-new-in-v5" class="anchor" href="#whats-new-in-v5" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's new in v5</h2>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Gradle and Maven compatibility! For now only snapshots are available, which can be accessed and added to Gradle builds by adding <code>compile 'com.github.amlcurran.showcaseview:library:5.0.0-SNAPSHOT'</code> to your dependencies. You will require the snapshot repository to be defined in your repositories.</li>
<li>Buidler pattern. It was much too difficult to create and set up a ShowcaseView, so there is now a Builder pattern available. This makes it dead easy to create a ShowcaseView.</li>
<li>New KitKat style showcase. Currently, this is only available by creating a Builder using the <code>new Builder(activity, true)</code> constructor.</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="user-content-whats-missing-in-v5" class="anchor" href="#whats-missing-in-v5" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's missing in v5</h2>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>ShowcaseViews: the class which queues up ShowcaseViews in a tutorial-type method. I never
really liked this class (generally, you should use SCV sparingly); I'll add it back in based on
the Builder class when I can.</li>
<li>Ghostly hand: this has gone for now until I can test-drive it back in.</li>
<li>Scale multiplier: this has gone for simplicity - if people really loved it I'll add in back in</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="user-content-faqs" class="anchor" href="#faqs" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FAQs</h2>

<p><strong>Where has X feature gone?</strong></p>

<p>Look one paragraph up!</p>

<p><strong>Waaaah, but I really liked feature X!!!</strong></p>

<p>Switch to the legacy branch and use that one then! All legacy features are in there.</p>

<p><strong>What happened to all the other constructors?</strong></p>

<p>Gone. You should be using the new Target API.</p>

<p><strong>What if I want to add feature X?</strong></p>

<p>At the moment, I'm not taking any feature requests. It's unlikely I'll take many anyway,
unless I feel they are both useful and well tested. If you have some cosmetic tweak then I don't
want that added into the library as <em>another</em> option. But, if you need to make a tweak to the
library to add such a tweak to your own, overridden ShowcaseView then that is totally great.</p>
