<p><a href="http://sqitch.org/">Sqitch</a> is a database change management application. It
currently supports PostgreSQL 8.4 and higher, SQLite 3.7.11 and higher, MySQL
5.6.4 and higher,, and Oracle 10g and higher.</p>

<p>What makes it different from your typical
<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html">migration</a> approaches? A few
things:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>
<p>No opinions</p>

<p>Sqitch is not integrated with any framework, ORM, or platform. Rather, it
is a standalone change management system with no opinions about your
database engine, application framework, or your development environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Native scripting</p>

<p>Changes are implemented as scripts native to your selected database
engine. Writing a <a href="http://postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> application? Write
SQL scripts for
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html"><code>psql</code></a>.
Writing an <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/">Oracle</a>-backed app?
Write SQL scripts for <a href="http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/SQL*Plus">SQL*Plus</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependency resolution</p>

<p>Database changes may declare dependencies on other changes -- even on
changes from other Sqitch projects. This ensures proper order of
execution, even when you've committed changes to your VCS out-of-order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No numbering</p>

<p>Change deployment is managed by maintaining a plan file. As such, there is
no need to number your changes, although you can if you want. Sqitch
doesn't much care how you name your changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iterative Development</p>

<p>Up until you tag and release your application, you can modify your change
deployment scripts as often as you like. They're not locked in just
because they've been committed to your VCS. This allows you to take an
iterative approach to developing your database schema. Or, better, you can
do test-driven database development.</p>

<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/theory/sqitch"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ae74d5e6f0700855bcf96bd7de97a327109b87a6/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f7468656f72792f7371697463682e706e67" alt="Build Status" data-canonical-src="https://travis-ci.org/theory/sqitch.png" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>

<p>To install Sqitch from a distribution download, type the following:</p>

<pre><code>perl Build.PL
./Build installdeps
./Build
./Build test
./Build install
</code></pre>

<p>To build from a Git clone, first install
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dist::Zilla">Dist::Zilla</a>, then use it to install
Sqitch and its dependencies:</p>

<pre><code>cpan Dist::Zilla
dzil install
</code></pre>

<p>To run Sqitch directly from the Git clone execute <code>t/sqitch</code>. If you're doing
development on Sqitch, you will need to install the autoring dependencies, as
well:</p>

<pre><code>dzil listdeps | xargs cpan
</code></pre>

<p>To install Sqitch on a specific platform, including Debian- and RedHat-derived
Linux distributions and Windows, see the
<a href="http://sqitch.org/#installation">Installation documentation</a>.</p>
