    MultiMarkdown

SYNOPSIS
    MultiMarkdown.pl [ --html4tags ] [ --version ] [ -shortversion ] [
    *file* ... ]

DESCRIPTION
    MultiMarkdown is an extended version of Markdown. See the website for
    more information.

            <a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/">http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/</a>

    Markdown is a text-to-HTML filter; it translates an easy-to-read /
    easy-to-write structured text format into HTML. Markdown's text format
    is most similar to that of plain text email, and supports features such
    as headers, *emphasis*, code blocks, blockquotes, and links.

    Markdown's syntax is designed not as a generic markup language, but
    specifically to serve as a front-end to (X)HTML. You can use span-level
    HTML tags anywhere in a Markdown document, and you can use block level
    HTML tags (like &lt;div&gt; and &lt;table&gt; as well).

    For more information about Markdown's syntax, see:

        <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/</a>

OPTIONS
    Use "--" to end switch parsing. For example, to open a file named "-z",
    use:

            Markdown.pl -- -z

    --html4tags
        Use HTML 4 style for empty element tags, e.g.:

            &lt;br&gt;

        instead of Markdown's default XHTML style tags, e.g.:

            &lt;br /&gt;

    -v, --version
        Display Markdown's version number and copyright information.

    -s, --shortversion
        Display the short-form version number.
