The BBC currently only provides two choices for accessing iPlayer content from a regular machine, either through it's windows desktop client or through adobe flash. There are apps for the iPhone and other devices and some set top boxes as well.

What the BBC do not cater for are people who use alternative operating systems or who do not wish to use the BBC's selected technologies (which, frankly, should be anyone not running windows since flash's performance is atrocious).

The BBC have a well documented platform neutrality policy which they seem to be reluctant to keep themselves to and after repeated digs at open source, I thought we'd show them what open source can do.

So get hacking!

PROMETHEUS

The original get_iplayer code is a mess. I initially began to gradually refactor it but encountered severe problems, largely owing to lexical scoping and variables being shared through scopes.

I gave up and started rewriting it instead. The original script is still there as 'get_iplayer' and i reverted it to the last version that Phil released.

Prometheus is the next generation of get_iplayer. It won't steal fire from the Gods, but it may enable you to use get_iplayer on a non-bbc-supported platform.
