<p>Munin is distributed under the GNU GPL version 2.  Munin is copyrighted
2002-2012 by its various authors as identified in the source files.</p>
<p>Munin is homed at <a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/">http://munin-monitoring.org/</a>.  After you have completed
the INSTALL all the documentation can be found there.</p>

<p>By sending us patches, you automatically license the code under the same terms
as Munin.</p>
<p>We also might edit your commits metadata (the comment part) for clarifications,
but we'll leave the diff part intact (except for whitespace edits). So in case
there's a problem with the commit diff, we either commit another patch
thereafter or plainly ask you to rework it. We might eventually squash some of
your commits into one.</p>
<p>Please always rebase your pull requests on a released version, ideally the
latest one. This makes the merging process much easier. The default branch,
<tt>master</tt>, automatically tracks the latest released version, so it is a very
good starting point.</p>
<p>If you request a pull against <tt>master</tt>, your pull will be automatically closed
upon release. If you request against <tt>devel</tt>, your pull will be automatically
closed upon merge.</p>
