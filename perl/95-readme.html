<a name="user-content-what-is-smartcd" class="anchor" href="#what-is-smartcd" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>WHAT IS SMARTCD?</h2>

<p>smartcd is a library for bash and zsh which brings transformative power
  to your fingertips.</p>

<p>The basic premise is that as you move around your computer using the shell,
  actions can be automatically taken to provide you with the environment you
  really want, not the one you're accustomed to putting up with.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-have-you-ever" class="anchor" href="#have-you-ever" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Have you ever...</h2>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><p>Created a file for a project to alter your environment by setting
variables or creating aliases so that things work correctly, one which
you need to remember to load by hand</p></li>
<li><p>Struggled to set up your shell's configuation to support conflicting
needs for different uses</p></li>
<li><p>Wished that your prompt could be made to say something or be a different
color when you are in a sensitive directory</p></li>
<li><p>Wanted a daemon process to run automatically when you go to work on a
project, and shut down when you finish</p></li>
<li><p>Wanted to automatically update your project from source control when you
enter</p></li>
<li><p>Needed to attach to a particular screen(1) session when working in
a particular directory</p></li>
</ul><p>These are just a few examples of problems people are solving with smartcd.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-ok-how-do-i-use-it" class="anchor" href="#ok-how-do-i-use-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OK, HOW DO I USE IT?</h2>

<p>It's stupid easy.  If you have already downloaded the archive or checked out
  the source, you can:</p>

<pre><code>make install
source load_smartcd
smartcd config
</code></pre>

<p>However, if you would rather skip all that and simply have it install itself,
  try this:</p>

<pre><code>curl -L http://smartcd.org/install | bash
</code></pre>

<p>Either method will prompt you to configure a small number of settings, and
  then help you set up your shell to load it on login.</p>

<p>Once it is installed, you're ready to go.  All actions are available through
  the <code>smartcd</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>Usage: smartcd ( edit | append | show | delete | filename | helper | template | setup | config ) [args]
</code></pre>

<p>If you run <code>smartcd edit enter</code>, it will launch your editor to allow you to
  begin creating a script for the current directory which will run when you
  enter.  Its counterpart, <code>smartcd edit leave</code>, will create a script that runs
  when you cd away from the current directory.</p>

<p>An auxiliary library is provided with smartcd called varstash.  This provides
  you with a powerful mechanism which saves the definitions of variables,
  aliases, and shell functions to allow you to change or unset them temporarily.
  Once you are finished, it will allow you to (or automatically) restore their
  prior values.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<pre><code>autostash PATH=/path/to/my/project/bin:$PATH
autostash alias restart="apachectl restart"
restart
</code></pre>

<p>will save the value of your $PATH, and prepend a project-specific directory
  to it.  smartcd will automagically restore its old value when you leave the
  directory.</p>

<p>The second line creates a temporary alias which is probably something only
  meaningful to the directory you are in, allowing you to keep concise aliases
  that won't get in your way, and allow you to re-use them between projects.</p>

<p>And these commands are immediately available, as shown by the third line,
  which makes use of the newly defined alias to restart your server.</p>

<p>You could instead create the files non-interactively</p>

<pre><code>echo 'autostash PATH=__PATH__/temporary/path:$PATH' | smartcd edit enter
</code></pre>

<p>which also highlights a convenient feature that replaces <strong>PATH</strong> with the
  directory name before the script is run.</p>

<p>If you like doing things by hand, you may prefer</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/.smartcd/scripts/some/directory
echo 'autostash PATH=__PATH__/temporary/path:$PATH' &gt;&gt; ~/.smartcd/scripts/some/directory/bash_enter
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-how-does-it-work" class="anchor" href="#how-does-it-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2>

<p>Scripts for smartcd are contained in a directory structure under your home,
  in the .smartcd directory.  As you change directory, it will look for files
  which correspond to where you are leaving from and going to, and run them for
  you.</p>

<p>The primary way of doing this is to create a "cd" function which calls
  <code>smartcd cd</code>. This also works with push and popd.  The simplest way to
  create these wrappers is to call <code>smartcd setup cd</code>, <code>smartcd setup pushd</code>,
  and <code>smartcd setup pushd</code>.  When you <code>smartcd config</code>, this will be set up
  for you.</p>

<p>If you prefer (or in addition), you can hook the prompt command.
  This sets PROMPT_COMMAND in bash, or precmd in zsh.  This is enabled using
  <code>smartcd setup prompt-hook</code>.  After calling smartcd, it will call any prior
  command for those hooks.  This feature allows users with the "autocd" option
  set in their shell to also benefit from smartcd.</p>

<p>The structure of .smartcd will mirror the filesystem hierarchy you wish to
  configure.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>  Path         Action      Script
------------------------------------------------------------
 /foo/bar       enter     ~/.smartcd/scripts/foo/bar/bash_enter
 /foo/bar/baz   leave     ~/.smartcd/scripts/foo/bar/baz/bash_leave
</code></pre>

<p>You can edit and read these files with the smartcd command using the
  "edit", "append", "show", and "filename" actions.</p>

<pre><code>user@host:/usr/local/bin$ smartcd filename enter
/home/user/.smartcd/scripts/usr/local/bin/bash_enter

user@host:/usr/local/bin$ smartcd show leave
No leave script for /usr/local/bin

user@host:/usr/local/bin$ smartcd show enter
# ---8&lt;--- begin /home/user/.smartcd/scripts/usr/local/bin/bash_enter
smartcd inform "testing"
# ---8&lt;--- end /home/user/.smartcd/scripts/usr/local/bin/bash_enter

# edit ~/.smartcd/scripts/usr/local/bin/bash_enter
user@host:/usr/local/bin$ smartcd edit enter

# truncate ~/.smartcd/scripts/usr/local/bin/bash_enter and replaces
# its contents with what is piped
user@host:/usr/local/bin$ echo "some-command" | smartcd edit enter

# add a line to ~/.smartcd/scripts/usr/local/bin/bash_enter
user@host:/usr/local/bin$ echo "some-command" | smartcd edit enter
</code></pre>

<p>One thing to note is that going from a directory to its child is not
  considered "leaving", so the bash_leave will not be run until you go to
  another directory that doesn't contain that same directory as part of
  its path.  The scripts are run as appropriate if they exist for each
  level going back to the common element between the paths.</p>

<p>If you cd from /foo/bar/baz to /foo/quux/biff, the following actions would
  take place:</p>

<pre><code>1) bash_leave for /foo/bar/baz
2) bash_leave for /foo/bar
3) bash_enter for /foo/quux
4) bash_enter for /foo/quux/biff
</code></pre>

<p>These scripts are run in the interactive shell using eval, so any variables
  or other environment effects will take place in the user's shell directly.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-what-are-some-common-recipes" class="anchor" href="#what-are-some-common-recipes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>WHAT ARE SOME COMMON RECIPES?</h2>

<p>Here are some examples of useful setups that have been created so far</p>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-display-a-message" class="anchor" href="#display-a-message" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>DISPLAY A MESSAGE</h3>

<p>Sometimes you may want a message to be shown when you enter or leave the
  directory, either to remind to you do something, or simply to let you know
  what the script has done.</p>

<p>You could use <code>echo</code> for this, but the issue with that is if you are doing
  something sophisticated with pipes, you may not want this message to
  interfere with the command being piped.  For example, you might use the
  following command to copy some files</p>

<pre><code>( cd foo; tar -cf - sub-dir ) | ( cd bar; tar -xf - )
</code></pre>

<p>but if "foo" has an enter script which echos something, this will corrupt
  the tar file.  By using <code>smartcd inform</code>, this will suppress the output when
  it is detected that the output is not a terminal</p>

<pre><code>smartcd inform "Reminder, don't forget to commit your code!"
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-prompt-color" class="anchor" href="#prompt-color" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PROMPT COLOR</h3>

<p>If you want a visual cue that you need to be careful, it might make sense
  to change your prompt.  Here's one that will temporarily make your prompt
  red while leaving its actual value alone.</p>

<pre><code>autostash PS1='\[\e[1;31m\]'"$PS1"'\[\e[0m\]'
</code></pre>

<p>Note the double-quotes around $PS1.  This is not superfluous, if your
  current value has any space characters in it, it's important to use quoting
  because otherwise it would be seen as a second argument to autostash</p>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-screen" class="anchor" href="#screen" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SCREEN</h3>

<p>This one can be a bit tricky since screen commands from within screen tend
  to confuse it.  And of course, creating a new screen window will execute
  your bash_enter scripts.</p>

<p>So what we'll do is set a variable in the attaching shell which is seen
  from within screen to prevent it from doing so.</p>

<pre><code>if [[ -z $MYSCREEN ]]; then
    autostash MYSCREEN=1
    screen -c __PATH__/.screenrc -RRD my-special-screen-session
fi
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-perlbrew" class="anchor" href="#perlbrew" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PERLBREW</h3>

<p>perlbrew is a system for installing multiple builds and versions of the Perl
  language, allowing you to easily switch between them.  This is very valuable
  for development, but probably not what you want for your whole system.</p>

<p>smartcd now ships with a helper designed to integrate perlbrew and smartcd
  seamlessly together.  Simply put this line in your enter script:</p>

<pre><code>smartcd helper run perlbrew init /path/to/perlbrew/install
</code></pre>

<p>When you leave the directory, perlbrew will stop being in effect and you will
  get your previous perl back.</p>

<p>perlbrew is available at <a href="http://search.cpan.org/%7Egugod/App-perlbrew/">http://search.cpan.org/~gugod/App-perlbrew/</a></p>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-locallib" class="anchor" href="#locallib" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>local::lib</h3>

<p>Perl currently ships with a module named local::lib, which is handy for
  installing module dependencies outside of the standard install locations.</p>

<p>A helper is included for interacting with this module as well.</p>

<pre><code>smartcd helper run perl-locallib activate __PATH__/perl5lib
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to explicitly remove a path (as you might do with
  -Mlocal::lib=--deactivate), this is supported</p>

<pre><code>smartcd helper run perl-locallib deactivate __PATH__/perl5lib
</code></pre>

<p>but not required.  If you don't perform this set, it will still be
  automatically cleared when you cd away restoring any prior local::lib
  or PERL5LIB state.</p>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-rvm" class="anchor" href="#rvm" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>RVM</h3>

<p>RVM is the Ruby Version Manager, which like perlbrew, can manage multiple
  versions of the language being installed at once.  Because it too wants to
  wrap the <code>cd</code> command, things are a little tricker than with perlbrew.
  Fortunately, the RVM project has added express support for smartcd as the
  action taken during its own cd.  If both projects are installed, RVM's cd()
  will call smartcd's, regardless of which order the two are set up.</p>

<p>RVM is available at <a href="https://rvm.io/">https://rvm.io/</a></p>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-stopstart" class="anchor" href="#stopstart" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>STOP/START</h3>

<p>If you want something to start running when you enter the directory, and
  stop running when you leave, you can certainly use smartcd for this.  Here's
  an example of how someone is using smartcd to start and stop a Plack service</p>

<pre><code>### enter script ###

# temporarily define the functions stop and start
autostash stop start pidfile="__PATH__/.pid"
start() {
    if [[ ! -f "$pidfile" ]] || ! kill -0 $(cat "$pidfile") &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; then
        (
            builtin cd __PATH__/html
            plackup &amp;&gt; /dev/null &amp;
            local pid=$!
            echo $pid &gt; "$pidfile"
            smartcd inform "Started Plack with pid $pid"
        )
    fi
}
stop() {
    if [[ -f "$pidfile" ]] &amp;&amp; kill -0 $(cat "$pidfile") &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; then
        kill $(cat "$pidfile")
        rm "$pidfile"
    fi
}

# Create an alias that calls both functions
autostash alias restart="stop; sleep 2; start"

# And automatically start-up on enter
start


### leave script ###

# Shut down when leaving.  Yes, this function is still available here, and
# it will be removed by autounstash after this leave is complete
stop

# There are several things to make a note of here
#
#   1) The sub-shell created in the start() function is not actually necessary
#      if `start` is _only_ run from within smartcd, since the extra `cd` command
#      will not prevent you from ending up in the right directory.  However, since
#      this function can be called manually, it's safer to do this in a subshell.
#
#   2) I used `builtin cd` instead of just `cd` in start() to avoid smartcd being
#      called during another call, possibly causing surprising results.  However,
#      if you actually want smartcd to be run in that situation, it's ok to do so.
#
#   3) Use __PATH__ liberally to ensure that files and actions are taken in the
#      correct place, even after you've changed to a subdirectory of where the script
#      was defined.
</code></pre>

<p>and of course, if you want to be sure that this daemon is shut down properly
  if you simply log out or close your shell, you will want the exit hook as well</p>

<pre><code># in your ~/.smartcd_config, see `smartcd config`
smartcd setup exit-hook
</code></pre>

<a name="user-content-what-else-can-it-do" class="anchor" href="#what-else-can-it-do" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>WHAT ELSE CAN IT DO?</h2>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-helpers" class="anchor" href="#helpers" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>HELPERS</h3>

<p>A system for pre-written scripts is provided which implement things that you
  may find useful.  This system allows people to distribute and share these
  independently of the core smartcd distribution.</p>

<p>Some helpers are provided with smartcd, including:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>
<p>path:</p>

<p>Simple ways to temporarily add elements to your PATH</p>

<pre><code>smartcd helper run path append __PATH__/bin
smartcd helper run path prepend __PATH__/bin
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>history:</p>

<p>This keeps commands run in the current and any subdirectories
in a separate history file specified as an argument.  The also-read
command will prepend another history file into the shell's buffer
when setting up, so that other history can be availble "further
back" in your history.</p>

<pre><code>smartcd helper run history also-read ~/.bash_history
smartcd helper run history localize __PATH__/.history
</code></pre>

<p>You can also have ask it to save and/or reload this history
file on each prompt</p>

<pre><code>smartcd helper run history prompt-append
smartcd helper run history prompt-reload
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>perlbrew:</p>

<p>Automagic setup and teardown of Perlbrew</p>

<pre><code>smartcd helper run perlbrew init /path/to/perlbrew/install
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="user-content-templates" class="anchor" href="#templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TEMPLATES</h3>

<p>In addition to configuring scripts individually, smartcd supports a template
  system, which can be set up to re-use common configuration among many
  directories.  This is controlled with the "smartcd template" action.</p>

<p>To create a new template based on the current directory, run:</p>

<pre><code>smartcd template create some_template_name
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a new template named "some_template_name", and prepopulate
  it from the bash_enter and bash_leave files corresponding to the working
  directory, replacing any instance of your working directory with <strong>PATH</strong>.</p>

<p>You can then edit the contents with <code>smartcd template edit some_template_name</code>.
  The <code>create</code> step is optional, and if you <code>edit</code> a template that is not yet
  created you will start with an empty one.</p>

<p>Now that your template is ready, you'll want to use it somewhere.  For this,
  there are two options:</p>

<ol class="task-list">
<li>
<p>Run it "in-place", and all changes to the template will be dynamically
picked up by the enter and exit scripts which execute it</p>

<pre><code>  echo 'smartcd template run some_template_name' | smartcd edit enter
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>run</code> action will determine if you are in an "enter" or "leave" script,
and execute the correct portion of the template.  This does not need to be
the only line in your script, and in fact you can even run more than one
template from the same script.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy the current contents of the template to the scripts for a directory,
as a one-time operation.  This will not automatically propagate changes to
the places it is in use, and can be used as a way to quickly bootstrap
scripts but allow them to exist independently.</p>

<pre><code>  smartcd template install some_template_name
</code></pre>

<p>The other template editor actions are <code>show</code>, <code>list</code>, and <code>delete</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol><h3>
<a name="user-content-nestable-prompt-commands" class="anchor" href="#nestable-prompt-commands" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>NESTABLE PROMPT COMMANDS</h3>

<p>Users can define their own actions which will be taken just before each
  prompt is displayed.  In fact, smartcd itself can use this mechanism to
  invoke itself.</p>

<p>smartcd on-prompt takes this concept to a new level.  By specifying commands
  to be run, they will be run on each prompt, similar to the built-in feature,
  but only while you are in the current directory and its children.  In
  addition to this, further on-prompt commands specified in child directories
  will run in addition to the current ones rather than replacing them.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>~/foo$ smartcd on-prompt 'echo test 1'
test 1
~/foo$ cd bar
test 1
~/foo/bar$ smartcd on-prompt 'echo test 2'
test 1
test 2
~/foo/bar$ cd ..
test 1
~/foo$ cd
~$
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-exit-hook" class="anchor" href="#exit-hook" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>EXIT HOOK</h3>

<p>By default, your enter scripts will be run when a shell is started.  However,
  the opposite is not the case.  If you'd like your leave scripts to run when
  the shell exits, smartcd is able to utilize the shell's EXIT trap hook to do
  so, or in zsh, the zshexit hook.  This is enabled by running</p>

<pre><code>smartcd setup exit-hook
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-backup" class="anchor" href="#backup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>BACKUP</h3>

<p>If you would like to back up your scripts and templates, or copy them to
  another computer, you can use the provided export/import feature.</p>

<pre><code># Export your scripts
smartcd export &gt; my_smartcd_backup

# Several methods to import them
smartcd import my_smartcd_backup
cat my_smartcd_backup | smartcd import
</code></pre>

<p>For more complete documentation, see the documentation in lib/core/smartcd.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-other-libraries" class="anchor" href="#other-libraries" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OTHER LIBRARIES</h2>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-varstash" class="anchor" href="#varstash" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>VARSTASH</h3>

<p>As already discussed, the included library lib/core/varstash provides several
  functions for saving values to a temporary location so that you can edit
  them, and then later restore the original value.</p>

<p>In addition to autostash, you could manually stash and unstash using
  functions with those names if there is some need to do so</p>

<pre><code>echo 'stash FOO=bar' | smartcd edit enter
echo 'unstash FOO' | smartcd edit leave
</code></pre>

<p>You may also trigger autostash's restore mechanism by calling</p>

<pre><code>autounstash
</code></pre>

<p>by hand.  It's safe to do so multiple times and it won't harm smartcd
  if you do this.</p>

<p>If you run stash, unstash, or autostash interactively, they will instruct
  you on how to create files for smartcd to run those commands for you.  If
  you do not wish to see this advice, set <code>VARSTASH_QUIET=1</code>.  The library can
  automatically follow its own advice and configure these files if you set
  <code>VARSTASH_AUTOCONFIG=1</code>.  It can do so, but also give you an opportunity to
  make additional edits to the relevant file, if you set <code>VARSTASH_AUTOEDIT=1</code>.</p>

<p>Alias stashing was briefly mentioned, and it is supported to do in-line
  stashing and declaration of an alias with autostash</p>

<pre><code>autostash alias mycmd="do something crazy"
</code></pre>

<p>However, stashing functions looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>autostash my_func
my_func() {
    some_new_definition
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's useful to autostash something even before it's set, because that
  triggers the mechanism which will unset them upon leaving.  Since functions
  cannot be declared inline with autostash, this is how you should do it.</p>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-arrays" class="anchor" href="#arrays" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ARRAYS</h3>

<p>Bash added array support in version 2.0, but it doesn't have a very good
  set of supporting built-ins.  In particular, I find myself missing the Perl
  functions push, pop, shift, unshift, reverse.</p>

<p>To provide these capabilities, another library, lib/core/arrays, is
  included.  The provided functions are:</p>

<pre><code>apush    - Add an element to the end of your array
apop     - Remove the last element from the array and print it
ashift   - Remove the first element from the array and print it
aunshift - Add an element to the beginning of the array
areverse - Reverse the order of elements in the array
afirst   - Like ashift, but doesn't remove anything.
alast    - Like apop, but doesn't remove anything.
anth     - Retreive the n-th element of an array.
alen     - Print the current number of elements in the array
acopy    - Copy an array into a new variable
</code></pre>

<p>See documentation included in lib/core/arrays for more detail.</p>
