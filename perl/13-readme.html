<p><strong>This is usually where you want to begin your journey.</strong></p>

<p>Here you'll find all the plugins coming from <a href="http://exchange.munin-monitoring.org/">http://exchange.munin-monitoring.org/</a>. 
That web site is for the time being disabled, new updates are done here.</p>

<p>If a dedicated website comes back alive, its plugin backend will be this git repo.</p>

<p>Feel free to update templates here, or even to create new ones.</p>

<p>Bonus points for mobile-friendly ones :)</p>

<p>Note that the one named <code>official</code> is a loose-synced copy of the one in SVN trunk. 
It should serves as a base for small editions that can be resynced in SVN trunk, so for that : </p>

<li>don't copy the whole template</li>

<p>Here, you can put just any kind of tool. Please use this directory instead of a random place on the internet. 
It makes things way more easy to search for others.</p>

<p>And, it serves as an incubator of SVN <code>trunk/contrib</code> :-)</p>

<p>This serves as a repository for examples of various configs. You know, the ''learn by example'' way of doing things.</p>

<p>We like to have ''elementary'' commits as it is much easier to manage for reviewing and debugging. 
So please <strong>don't</strong> be afraid to make <strong>as many</strong> commits as needed. Merging many commits is as easy
as merging one, if not easier.</p>

<p>A good rationale is that each commit shall have a one-liner commit comment as its first line. 
Next lines are optional and should only explain the ''why'' it is done this particular way.</p>

<p>On the other side, pull requests can regroup many commits at once.
Just try to explain in the pull comment the ''why'' we should merge it (if it's not obvious).</p>

<p>Tim Pope wrote a <a href="http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">very nice tuto</a> on making good commit comments.</p>

<a name="user-content-licenses" class="anchor" href="#licenses" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Licenses</h3>

<p>All the code here is licensed with the same terms as munin itself (GPLv2), unless specified otherwise inside a file.
In all cases the code shall have an OSI-compatible license. Asking for a pull implies that you agree with that fact.</p>

<p>This change was made on Jun 1st 2012. If you wrote some code earlier and you do not agree to the new licensing default, you can  :</p>

<li>submit a licensing change pull</li>
<li>submit a removal pull </li>
