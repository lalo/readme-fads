===============

This is intended to be a repository for all kinds of Perl
6 examples.

All examples should work for any full implementation of Perl 6.

If an example needs an implementation specific version then it
should end in .implementation.  For example, if you are making
an example that only works on Rakudo, it should end in .rakudo.

If you want to contribute, just ask! The quicker choice is to
use IRC: join #perl6 in Freenode and you'll be welcome.


Please use POD ( mostly this template &lt;<a href="https://github.com/perl6/perl6-examples/blob/master/template_pod">https://github.com/perl6/perl6-examples/blob/master/template_pod</a>&gt; ) when adding a new example.

Goals
-----

1. Compile a list of open source Perl 6 examples
2. Help different implementations of Perl 6 test out their code in a less
   testy and more fun manner ;)
