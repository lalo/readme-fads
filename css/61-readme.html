<p>A showcase of problems once hard or impossible to solve with CSS alone, now made trivially easy with Flexbox.</p>

<p>The Solved by Flexbox site is built with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and depends on several other Ruby gems (e.g. <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer">Autoprefixer</a>).</p>

<p>There are also a few client-side dependencies, which are managed with <a href="http://bower.io">Bower</a>.</p>

<p>To install all the dependencies simply run the commands:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-sh"><pre>bundle install
bower install
</pre></div>

<p>Once all the dependencies are installed, you can preview the site locally with the following rake task:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-sh"><pre>rake preview
</pre></div>

<p>This starts up a local server at port 4000. If you want to use a different port, you can pass the port number as an argument to the rake task:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-sh"><pre>rake preview<span class="o">[</span>8080<span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In addition to building the site and serving it locally, the <code>rake preview</code> task will also listen for any changes and rebuild as needed. This allows you to play around with the code, refresh the browser, and see your changes instantly.</p></article></div>
