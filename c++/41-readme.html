<p>This is the vowpal wabbit fast online learning code.  For Windows, look at README.windows.txt</p>

<p>You can download the latest version from here:
<a href="https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Download">https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Download</a></p>

<p>Alternatively, the very latest version is available here:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit.git
</code></pre>

<p>You should be able to build it on most systems with:
make
(make test)</p>

<p>If that fails, try:</p>

<pre><code>./autogen.sh
make
(make test)
make install
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>./autogen.sh</code> requires automake.  On OSX, this implies installing
'glibtools'.</p>

<p>Options that were passed to <code>./configure</code> in 7.6 and earlier may now be passed
to <code>./autogen.sh</code>.</p>

<p>Be sure to read the wiki: <a href="https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki">https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki</a>
for the tutorial, command line options, etc.  </p>

<p>The 'cluster' directory has it's own documentation for cluster
parallel use, and the examples at the end of test/Runtests give some
example flags.</p></article></div>
