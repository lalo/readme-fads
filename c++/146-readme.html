<p>git-crypt enables transparent encryption and decryption of files in a
git repository.  Files which you choose to protect are encrypted when
committed, and decrypted when checked out.  git-crypt lets you freely
share a repository containing a mix of public and private content.
git-crypt gracefully degrades, so developers without the secret key can
still clone and commit to a repository with encrypted files.  This lets
you store your secret material (such as keys or passwords) in the same
repository as your code, without requiring you to lock down your entire
repository.</p>

<p>git-crypt was written by Andrew Ayer .  For

<p>Generate a secret key:</p>

<pre><code>git-crypt keygen /path/to/keyfile
</code></pre>

<p>Configure a repository to use encryption:</p>

<pre><code>cd repo
git-crypt init /path/to/keyfile
</code></pre>

<p>Specify files to encrypt by creating a .gitattributes file:</p>

<pre><code>secretfile filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
*.key filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
</code></pre>

<p>Like a .gitignore file, it can match wildcards and should be checked
into the repository.  Make sure you don't accidentally encrypt the
.gitattributes file itself!</p>

<p>Cloning a repository with encrypted files:</p>

<pre><code>git clone /path/to/repo
cd repo
git-crypt init /path/to/keyfile
</code></pre>

<p>That's all you need to do - after running <code>git-crypt init</code>, you can use
git normally - encryption and decryption happen transparently.</p>

<a name="user-content-current-status" class="anchor" href="#current-status" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current Status</h2>

<p>The latest version of git-crypt is <a href="NEWS.md">0.3</a>, released on
2013-04-05.  git-crypt aims to be bug-free and reliable, meaning it
shouldn't crash, malfunction, or expose your confidential data.
However, it has not yet reached maturity, meaning it is not as
documented, featureful, or easy-to-use as it should be.  Additionally,
there may be backwards-incompatible changes introduced before version
1.0.</p>

<p>Development on git-crypt is currently focused on improving the user
experience, especially around setting up repositories.  There are also
plans to add additional key management schemes, such as
passphrase-derived keys and keys encrypted with PGP.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-security" class="anchor" href="#security" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Security</h2>

<p>git-crypt is more secure that other transparent git encryption systems.
git-crypt encrypts files using AES-256 in CTR mode with a synthetic IV
derived from the SHA-1 HMAC of the file.  This is provably semantically
secure under deterministic chosen-plaintext attack.  That means that
although the encryption is deterministic (which is required so git can
distinguish when a file has and hasn't changed), it leaks no information
beyond whether two files are identical or not.  Other proposals for
transparent git encryption use ECB or CBC with a fixed IV.  These
systems are not semantically secure and leak information.</p>

<p>The AES key is stored unencrypted on disk.  The user is responsible for
protecting it and ensuring it's safely distributed only to authorized
people.  A future version of git-crypt may support encrypting the key
with a passphrase.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-limitations" class="anchor" href="#limitations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Limitations</h2>

<p>git-crypt is not designed to encrypt an entire repository.  Not only
does that defeat the aim of git-crypt, which is the ability to
selectively encrypt files and share the repository with less-trusted
developers, there are probably better, more efficient ways to encrypt an
entire repository, such as by storing it on an encrypted filesystem.
Also note that git-crypt is somewhat of an abuse of git's smudge, clean,
and textconv features.  Junio Hamano, git's maintainer, has <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/113124/focus=113221">said not to
do this</a>, though his main objection ("making a pair of similar
'smudged' contents totally dissimilar in their 'clean' counterparts.")
does not apply here since git-crypt uses deterministic encryption.</p>

<p>git-crypt does not itself provide any authentication.  It assumes that
either the master copy of your repository is stored securely, or that
you are using git's existing facilities to ensure integrity (signed
tags, remembering commit hashes, etc.).</p>
