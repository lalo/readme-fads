<p>HElib is a software library that implements <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption" title="Homomorphic encryption">homomorphic encryption</a> (HE). Currently available is an implementation of the <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/277" title="BGV12">Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan</a> (BGV) scheme, along with many optimizations to make homomorphic evaluation runs faster, focusing mostly on effective use of the <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/133" title="SV11">Smart-Vercauteren</a> ciphertext packing techniques and the <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/099" title="GHS12">Gentry-Halevi-Smart</a> optimizations.</p>

<p>At its present state, this library is mostly meant for researchers working on HE and its uses. Also currently it is fairly low-level, and is best thought of as "assembly language for HE". That is, it provides low-level routines (set, add, multiply, shift, etc.), with as much access to optimizations as we can give. Hopefully in time we will be able to provide higher-level routines.</p>

<p>We still do not have an implementation of bootstrapping, hence so far we can only support "leveled" HE, where the parameters must be set large enough to evaluate the desired functionality.</p>

<p>This library is written in C++ and uses the <a href="http://www.shoup.net/ntl/" title="NTL">NTL mathematical library</a> (version 6.1.0 or higher). It is distributed under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" title="GPL">GNU General Public License</a> (GPL).</p></article></div>
