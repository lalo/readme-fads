<a name="user-content-reporting-issues" class="anchor" href="#reporting-issues" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reporting Issues</h2>

<p>If you encounter an issue while using Half-Life 1 games, first search the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/halflife/issues">issue list</a> to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search.</p>

<p>If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>a short, descriptive title;</li>
<li>a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;</li>
<li>steps for reproducing the issue;</li>
<li>your system information.*; and</li>
<li>the <code>version</code> output from the in‐game console.</li>
</ul><p>Please place logs either in a code block (press <code>M</code> in your browser for a GFM cheat sheet) or a <a href="https://gist.github.com">gist</a>.</p>

<p>* The preferred and easiest way to get this information is from Steam's Hardware Information viewer from the menu (<code>Help -&gt; System Information</code>). Once your information appears: right-click within the dialog, choose <code>Select All</code>, right-click again, and then choose <code>Copy</code>. Paste this information into your report, preferably in a code block.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-conduct" class="anchor" href="#conduct" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conduct</h2>

<p>There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions.  While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.</li>
<li>Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.</li>
<li>Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.</li>
<li>Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.</li>
</ul><p>Remember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with Half-Life.  As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested.  Patience is always appreciated.</p></article></div>
