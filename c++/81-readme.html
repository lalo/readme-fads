<div class="announce instapaper_body md" data-path="README.md" id="readme"><article class="markdown-body entry-content" itemprop="mainContentOfPage"><p>Halide is a programming language designed to make it easier to write
high-performance image processing code on modern machines. Halide
currently targets X86, ARM, CUDA, OpenCL, and OpenGL on OS X, Linux,
and Windows.</p>

<p>Rather than being a standalone programming language, Halide is
embedded in C++. This means you write C++ code that builds an
in-memory representation of a Halide pipeline using Halide's C++
API. You can then compile this representation to an object file, or
JIT-compile it and run it in the same process.</p>

<p>For more detail about what Halide is, see <a href="http://halide-lang.org">http://halide-lang.org</a>.</p>

<p>For API documentation see <a href="http://halide-lang.org/docs">http://halide-lang.org/docs</a></p>

<p>To see some example code, look in the tutorials directory.</p>

<p>If you've acquired a full source distribution and want to build
Halide, see the notes below.</p>

<p>HL_NUM_THREADS=... specifies the size of the thread pool. This has no
effect on OS X or iOS, where we just use grand central dispatch.</p>

<p>HL_TRACE=1 injects print statements into compiled Halide code that
will describe what the program is doing at runtime. Higher values
print more detail.</p>

<p>HL_TRACE_FILE=... specifies a binary target file to dump tracing data
into. The output can be parsed programmatically by starting from the
code in utils/HalideTrace.cpp</p>

<p>HL_PROFILE=1 injects timing data collection code. The output can be
parsed using utils/HalideProf.cpp</p>

<p>Precompiled Halide distributions are built using XCode's command-line
tools with Apple clang 500.2.76. This means that we link against
libc++ instead of libstdc++. You may need to adjust compiler options
accordingly if you're using an older XCode which does not default to
libc++.</p>

<p>For parallelism, Halide automatically uses Apple's Grand Central
Dispatch, so it is not possible to control the number of threads used
without overriding the parallel runtime entirely.</p>

<a name="user-content-building-halide" class="anchor" href="#building-halide" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building Halide</h1>

<p>Building halide requires at least llvm 3.3, along with the matching
version of clang. llvm-config and clang must be somewhere in the
path. If your OS does not have packages for llvm-3.3, you can find
binaries for it at <a href="http://llvm.org/releases/download.html">http://llvm.org/releases/download.html</a>. Download an
appropriate package and then either install it, or at least put the
bin subdirectory in your path. (This works well on OS X and Ubuntu.)</p>

<p>If you want to build it yourself, first check it out from subversion:</p>

<p>% svn co <a href="https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/branches/release_33">https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/branches/release_33</a> llvm3.3
% svn co <a href="https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/branches/release_33">https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/branches/release_33</a> llvm3.3/tools/clang</p>

<p>Then build it like so:</p>

<p>% cd llvm3.3
% ./configure --disable-terminfo --enable-optimized --enable-assertions --with-clang --enable-targets=x86,arm,nvptx
% make -j8</p>

<p>(Users of OSX 10.8+ may need to explicitly specify GCC vs Clang,
prepending "CC=gcc CXX=g++" to the configure command.)</p>

<p>Then finally tell Halide's Makefile about it like so:</p>

<p>% export LLVM_CONFIG=/Release+Asserts/bin/llvm-config
% export CLANG=/Release+Asserts/bin/clang</p>

<p>If you wish to use cmake to build llvm, the build procedure is:</p>

<p>% cd llvm3.3
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake -DLLVM_ENABLE_TERMINFO=OFF -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86;ARM;NVPTX" -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
% make -j8</p>

<p>then to point Halide to it:</p>

<p>export LLVM_CONFIG=/build/bin/llvm-config
export CLANG=/build/bin/clang</p>

<p>On Ubuntu llvm 3.2 also works, but you should omit --disable-terminfo
or -DLLVM_ENABLE_TERMINFO=OFF when configuring it.</p>

<p>With LLVM_CONFIG and CLANG set (or the appropriate llvm-config and
clang in your path), you should be able to just run 'make' in this
directory. 'make run_tests' will run the JIT test suite, and 'make
test_apps' will make sure all the apps compile and run (but won't
check their output).</p>

<p>There is no 'make install' yet. If you want to make an install
package, run 'make distrib'.</p>

<p>This is necessary if you want to JIT compile 32-bit code. It is not
necessary for AOT compiling 32-bit Halide pipelines. The 64-bit
version of Halide cross-compiles 32-bit code just fine.</p>

<p>To get a 32-bit llvm, configure and compile it like so:
  % CC="gcc -m32" CXX="g++ -m32" ./configure --enable-targets=x86,arm,nvptx --enable-assertions --enable-optimized --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu
  % CC="gcc -m32" CXX="g++ -m32" make</p>

<p>To generate a 32-bit Halide, compile it like so:
  % HL_TARGET=x86-32 LD="ld -melf_i386" CC="gcc -m32" CXX="g++ -m32" make</p>

<p>You should then be able to run the JIT tests with a 32-bit target:
  % CXX="g++ -m32 -msse4" make build_tests
  % HL_TARGET=x86-32-sse41 make run_tests</p>

<p>If you have a 32-bit libpng, you can also run the apps in 32-bit:
  % HL_TARGET=x86-32-sse41 CXX="g++ -m32 -msse4" make test_apps
The tests should pass, but the tutorials will fail to compile unless
you manually supply a 32-bit libpng.</p>

<a name="user-content-building-halide-with-native-client-support" class="anchor" href="#building-halide-with-native-client-support" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building Halide with Native Client support</h2>

<p>Halide is capable of generating Native Client (NaCl) object files and
Portable Native Client (PNaCl) bitcode.  JIT compilation is not
supported. For both NaCl and PNaCl, the PNaCl llvm tree is used as it
contains required llvm headers and libraries for compiling to all
Native Client targets.</p>

<p>In order to build Halide with Native Client support, one will need the
PNaCl llvm tree from:
    <a href="http://git.chromium.org/native_client/pnacl-llvm.git">http://git.chromium.org/native_client/pnacl-llvm.git</a>
and, for good measure, PNaCl's version of clang:
    <a href="http://git.chromium.org/native_client/pnacl-clang.git">http://git.chromium.org/native_client/pnacl-clang.git</a>
To check these out:
  % git clone <a href="http://git.chromium.org/native_client/pnacl-llvm.git">http://git.chromium.org/native_client/pnacl-llvm.git</a> pnacl-llvm
  % cd pnacl-llvm/tools
  % git clone <a href="http://git.chromium.org/native_client/pnacl-clang.git">http://git.chromium.org/native_client/pnacl-clang.git</a> clang
  % cd ../..</p>

<p>To enable all Halide targets, build it like so:
  % mkdir build
  % cd build
  % cmake -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86;ARM;NVPTX" -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
  % make -j8</p>

<p>It will possibly be helpful to get the entire dev tree for
PNaCl. Documentation for this is here:
    <a href="http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/pnacl/developing-pnacl">http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/pnacl/developing-pnacl</a></p>

<p>To use generated code in an application, you'll of course also need
the Native Client SDK:
    <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/sdk/download">https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/sdk/download</a></p>

<p>Once The Native Client prerequisites are in place, set the following
variables (on the command line or by editing the Makefile):</p>

<p>Point LLVM_CONFIG to the llvm-config that lives in your pnacl llvm
 build. E.g:</p>

<p>% export LLVM_CONFIG=/llvm/pnacl-llvm/build/bin/llvm-config</p>

<p>Change WITH_NATIVE_CLIENT to "true" (or any non-empty value):</p>

<p>% export WITH_NATIVE_CLIENT=true</p>

<p>With these variables set, run make. This will build a Halide lib
capable of generating native client objects. Neither the tests nor
most of the apps Makefiles have been updated to work with cross
compilation however. Try the app HelloNacl for a working example.</p>

<a name="user-content-halide-openglglsl-backend" class="anchor" href="#halide-openglglsl-backend" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Halide OpenGL/GLSL backend</h1>

<p>Halide's OpenGL backend offloads image processing operations to the GPU by
generating GLSL-based fragment shaders.</p>

<p>Compared to other GPU-based processing options such as CUDA and OpenCL, OpenGL
has two main advantages: it is available on basically every desktop computer
and mobile device, and it is generally well supported across different
hardware vendors.</p>

<p>The main disadvantage of OpenGL as an image processing framework is that the
computational capabilities of fragment shaders are quite restricted. In
general, the processing model provided by OpenGL is most suitable for filters
where each output pixel can be expressed as a simple function of the input
pixels. This covers a wide range of interesting operations like point-wise
filters and convolutions; but a few common image processing operations such as
histograms or recursive filters are notoriously hard to express in GLSL.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-writing-opengl-based-filters" class="anchor" href="#writing-opengl-based-filters" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Writing OpenGL-Based Filters</h2>

<p>To enable code generation for OpenGL, include "opengl" in the target specifier
passed to Halide. Since OpenGL shaders are limited in their computational
power, you must also specify a CPU target for those parts of the filter that
cannot or should not be computed on the GPU. Examples of valid target
specifiers are</p>

<p>host-opengl
  x86-opengl-gpu_debug</p>

<p>Adding "gpu_debug", as in the second example, adds additional logging output
and is highly recommended during development.</p>

<p>By default, filters compiled for OpenGL targets run completely on the CPU.
Execution on the GPU must be enabled for individual Funcs by appropriate
scheduling calls.</p>

<p>GLSL fragment shaders implicitly iterate over two spatial dimensions x,y and
the color channel. Due to the way color channels handled in GLSL, only filters
for which the color index is a compile-time constant can be scheduled.  The
main consequence is that the range of color variables must be explicitly
specified for both input and output buffers before scheduling:</p>

<p>ImageParam input;
  Func f;
  Var x, y, c;
  f(x, y, c) = ...;</p>

<p>input.set_bounds(2, 0, 3);   // specify color range for input
  f.bound(c, 0, 3);            // and output
  f.glsl(x, y, c);</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-jit-compilation" class="anchor" href="#jit-compilation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>JIT Compilation</h2>

<p>For JIT compilation Halide attempts to load the system libraries for opengl
and creates a new context to use for each module. Windows is not yet supported.</p>

<p>Examples for JIT execution of OpenGL-based filters can be found in test/opengl.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-aot-compilation" class="anchor" href="#aot-compilation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>AOT Compilation</h2>

<p>When AOT (ahead-of-time) compilation is used, Halide generates OpenGL-enabled
object files that can be linked to and called from a host application. In
general, this is fairly straightforward, but a few things must be taken care
of.</p>

<p>On Linux, OS X, and Android, Halide creates its own OpenGL context unless the
current thread already has an active context.  On other platforms you have to
link implementations of the following two functions with your Halide code:</p>

<p>extern "C" int halide_opengl_create_context(void *) {
      return 0;  // if successful
  }</p>

<p>extern "C" void *halide_opengl_get_proc_addr(void *, const char *name) {
      ...
  }</p>

<p>Halide allocates and deletes textures as necessary.  Applications may manage
the textures by hand by setting the 'dev' field in buffer_t; this is most
useful for reusing image data that is already stored in textures. Some
rudimentary checks are performed to ensure that externally allocated textures
have the correct format, but in general that's the responsibility of the
application.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-limitations" class="anchor" href="#limitations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Limitations</h2>

<p>GLSL shaders can only express a subset of the Halide language.  The current
implementation of the OpenGL backend targets OpenGL ES 2.0, which has
additional restrictions, but is widely available on both mobile devices and
traditional computers. Some limitations include:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><p>Only uint8 textures are properly supported so far. uint16 buffers work in
principle, but are truncated to 8 bits by many OpenGL implementations.
Support for float and half-float textures is planned for the near future.</p></li>
<li><p>Only 2D images with 1, 3, or 4 color channels can be scheduled;</p></li>
<li><p>Textures are either read-only or write-only, never read-write;</p></li>
<li><p>Reductions cannot be implemented in GLSL and must be run on the CPU.</p></li>
</ul><p>The maximum texture size in OpenGL is GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE, which is often
smaller than the image of interest; on mobile devices, for example,
GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE is commonly 2048. Tiling must be used to process larger
images.</p></article></div>
