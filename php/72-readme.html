<p>Python has one. Ruby has one. Clojure has one. Now PHP has one too. Boris is
PHP's missing REPL (read-eval-print loop), allowing developers to experiment
with PHP code in the terminal in an interactive manner.  If you make a mistake,
it doesn't matter, Boris will report the error and stand to attention for
further input.</p>

<p>Everything you enter into Boris is evaluated and the result inspected so you
can understand what is happening.  State is maintained between inputs, allowing
you to gradually build up a solution to a problem.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?</h2>

<p>I'm in the process of transitioning away from PHP to Ruby.  I have come to find
PHP's lack of a real REPL to be frustrating and was not able to find an existing
implementation that was complete.  Boris weighs in at a few hundred lines of
fairly straightforward code.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>When Boris starts, you will be at the <code>boris&gt;</code> prompt. PHP code you enter at
this prompt is evaluated.  If an expression spans multiple lines, Boris will
collect the input and then evaluate the expression when it is complete. Press
CTRL-C to clear a multi-line input buffer if you make a mistake. The output
is dumped with <code>var_dump()</code> by default.</p>

<pre><code>boris&gt; $x = 1;
int(1)
boris&gt; $y = 2;
int(2)
boris&gt; "x + y = " . ($x + $y);
string(9) "x + y = 3"
boris&gt; exit;
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use CTRL-D to exit the REPL.</p>

<p>Long-running operations, such as infinite loops, may be cancelled at any time
without quitting the REPL, by using CTRL-C while the operation is running.</p>

<pre><code>boris&gt; for ($i = 0; ; ++$i) {
    *&gt;   if ($i % 2 == 0) printf("Tick\n");
    *&gt;   else             printf("Tock\n");

<p>You can also use Boris as part of a larger project (e.g. with your application
environment loaded).</p>

<pre><code>require_once 'lib/autoload.php';

$boris = new \Boris\Boris('myapp&gt; ');
$boris-&gt;start();
</code></pre>

<p>The constructor parameter is optional and changes the prompt.</p>

<p>If you want to pass local variables straight into Boris (e.g. parts of your
application), you can do that too (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/dhotston">@dhotston</a>):</p>

<pre><code>$boris = new \Boris\Boris('myapp&gt; ');
$boris-&gt;setLocal(array('appContext' =&gt; $appContext));
$boris-&gt;start();
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, $appContext will be present inside the REPL.</p>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-using-start-hooks" class="anchor" href="#using-start-hooks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using start hooks</h3>

<p>It is possible to add callbacks to Boris that are executed inside the REPL
before it begins looping. Any number of hooks can be added, and they will be
executed in order. Any variables set or exported by the hook will become
visible from inside the REPL and consequently, to subsequent hooks that are
run.</p>

<p>There are two ways to specify hooks: as arbitrary strings of PHP code to
evaluate, or as callbacks given as closures. Both approaches allow you access
to the scope, though you need to do slightly more work with the callback
approach.</p>

<pre><code>// this will simply be evaluated in the REPL scope
// the variables $foo and $bar will be visible inside the REPL
$boris-&gt;onStart('$foo = 42; $bar = 2; echo "Hello Boris!\n";');

// this will be passed the REPL and it's scope as arguments
// any changes to the scope can be expressed by invoking the usual
// methods on the REPL
$boris-&gt;onStart(function($worker, $scope){
  extract($scope); // we could also just access specific vars by key

  echo '$foo * $bar = ' . ($foo * $bar) . "\n";

  $worker-&gt;setLocal('name', 'Chris');
});
</code></pre>

<p>Above we added two hooks. The first just gets passed to <code>eval()</code> and leaves
<code>$foo</code> and <code>$bar</code> in scope. The second uses the callback style and reads its
variables from the <code>$scope</code> parameter, then sets variables into the REPL
with <code>setLocal()</code>.</p>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-user-configuration-files" class="anchor" href="#user-configuration-files" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>User configuration files</h3>

<p>If you have, things you always want to do when Boris starts, such as load
useful utility functions, change the prompt or set local variable, you
may create a ~/.borisrc file, which will be loaded whenever Boris starts up.</p>

<p>The contents of this file are just arbitrary PHP code. You are <em>not</em> inside
the REPL itself in this file, but you have access to <code>$boris</code>, which is the
REPL object. Here's an example ~/.borisrc that sets the prompt.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

/* File: ~/.borisrc */

$boris-&gt;setPrompt('prompty&gt; ');
</code></pre>

<p>Boris will also look under your current working directory for this file. If
it finds one on both locations, they will both be loaded by default (not that
this is customizable at the code level). If you need to execute code in the
REPL itself, use hooks as documented above.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/filp">@filp</a> for this feature!</p>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-customizing-the-output" class="anchor" href="#customizing-the-output" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Customizing the output</h3>

<p>After each expression you enter, Boris passes it through an Inspector to get a
representation that is useful for debugging. The default is does some nice
highlighting of the data types in the value, to make it easier to read at a
glance, but you can change this behaviour.</p>

<p>Any object that has an <code>inspect($variable)</code> method may be used for this purpose.</p>

<pre><code>$boris-&gt;setInspector(new BlinkInspector());
</code></pre>

<p>Boris comes with three alternatives out of the box:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>\Boris\ColoredInspector, which does data-type highlighting and is the default</li>
<li>\Boris\DumpInspector, which uses a simple, but effective var_dump()</li>
<li>\Boris\ExportInspector, which uses var_export()</li>
</ul><p>Note that you can change this from inside the REPL too:</p>

<pre><code>boris&gt; $this-&gt;setInspector(new \Boris\ExportInspector());
-&gt; NULL
boris&gt; "Test";
-&gt; 'Test'
</code></pre>

<p>To further customize object output within <code>\Boris\ColoredInspector</code>, you may
subclass and override the <code>objectVars($value)</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>class MyInspector extends \Boris\ColoredInspector {
    public function objectVars($value) {
        if ($value instanceof User) {
            return array('user_id' =&gt; $value-&gt;getUserId());
        }

        return parent::objectVars($value);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This overrides the default behavior of simply calling <a href="http://php.net/get_object_vars"><code>get_object_vars()</code></a>
on the object, allowing you to display properties that may be otherwise obfuscated
behind magic methods or property visibility.</p>

<p>Boris honours your environment. If your application has error handlers
installed, they will mask the error. Likewise, if an exception handler is
installed, you won't see a backtrace (unless your exception handler displays it).</p>

<p>Since Boris is much more useful when you can see errors in the console, the best
thing to do is to disable any exception/error handlers when your application
is running inside of Boris.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-what-about-phps-interactive-mode" class="anchor" href="#what-about-phps-interactive-mode" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What about PHP's interactive mode?</h2>

<p>PHP's interactive mode does not print the result of evaluating expressions and
more importantly, it exits if you type something that produces a fatal error,
such as invoking a function/method that does not exist, or an uncaught
exception.  Boris is designed to be robust, like other REPLs, so you can
experiment with things that you know may error, without losing everything.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-architecture-overview" class="anchor" href="#architecture-overview" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Architecture Overview</h2>

<p>This section of the README only applies to those curious enough to read the
code. Boris is quite different to other PHP REPLs, because it deals with fatal
errors (not Exceptions, fatal errors) in a special way.</p>

<p>Boris will only work on POSIX systems (Linux and Mac OS).  This is primarily
because it depends on the ability to fork, but also because it plays with signals
a lot too.</p>

<p>Boris is made up of two parts:</p>

<ol class="task-list">
<li>A REPL worker process, which receives expressions to evaluate and print</li>
<li>A readline client, which simply takes your input, sends it to the worker
 and then loops</li>
</ol><p>If all errors in PHP were exceptions, building a REPL would be simple. This is
not the case, however.  Some PHP errors are truly fatal and cannot be caught.
In order to prevent such fatal errors from killing the REPL, the worker looks
something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for(;;) {
  $input = accept_some_input();
  if (fork_child()) {
    wait_for_child();
  } else { // inside child
    var_dump(eval($input));
    kill_parent();
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The child is forked with all current variables and resources.  It evaluates the
input then kills the parent, then the loop continues inside the child, waiting
for the next input.</p>

<p>While the child is evaluating the input, the parent waits. The parent is
expecting the worst—that the child will die abnormally—at which point the parent
continues waiting for input and does not terminate.  The state remains unchanged.</p>

<p>After each expression is evaluated, the worker reports back to the main process
with a status code of 0 (keep running) or 1 (terminate).</p>

<p>The main process (readline) of Boris is much more straightforward.  It takes
your input, performs a (very) shallow parse on it, in order to decide if it
needs to wait for further input, or evaluate the input (one statement at a time)
it has received.  If the worker reports back with a status code of 1, the process
terminates, otherwise the next iteration of the loop is entered.</p>

<a name="user-content-will-it-work-with" class="anchor" href="#will-it-work-with" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Will it work with...?</h2>

<p>Boris depends on the following PHP features:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>PHP &gt;= 5.3</li>
<li>The Readline functions</li>
<li>The PCNTL functions</li>
<li>The POSIX functions</li>
</ul><p>There's no chance it can work on Windows, due to the dependency on POSIX
features (the code is almost entirely dependant on POSIX).</p>
