SSH allows command line access to your openelec.tv machine for configuration
and file transfer. Linux/Mac clients can natively use SSH, while Windows
users might want to try PuTTY for their terminal access.</li>
<li>$HOME is mounted on /storage (the second ext4 partition on the drive). 
All data transfered to the machine will go here, the rest of the system is
read-only with the exception of /var (containing runtime configuration data).</li>
<li>Manual update/downgrade procedure is as follows:
Extract the snapshot and navigate to the 'target' directory.
Copy KERNEL and SYSTEM along with KERNEL.md5 and SYSTEM.md5 to the 'Update' network share (or /storage/.update) on
your openelec machine. Your system will automatically upgrade during the 
next reboot.</li>
<li>Automatic mounting of filesystems is supported. Devices such as USB Flash 
sticks can be plugged into a running machine and will be mounted to /media,
showing up in xbmc’s GUI.</li>
<li>Comments and questions are more than welcome, help is even better and patches
