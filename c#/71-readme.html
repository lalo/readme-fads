<a href="http://nuget.org/">NuGet Gallery</a> - Where packages are found </h1>

<p>This is an implementation of the NuGet Gallery and API. This serves as the back-end and community 
website for the NuGet client. For information about the NuGet clients, visit <a href="http://nuget.codeplex.com/">http://nuget.codeplex.com/</a></p>

<ol class="task-list">
<li>Prerequisites. Install these if you don't already have them:

<ol class="task-list">
<li>Visual Studio 2013</li>
<li>PowerShell 2.0 (comes with Windows 7+)</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/installing-nuget">NuGet</a></li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/sdk/">Windows Azure SDK v2.2</a> - Note that later versions may be supported, but will require you to manually upgrade the ".Cloud" projects in the solution.</li>
<li>(Optional, for unit tests) <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/463c5987-f82b-46c8-a97e-b1cde42b9099">xUnit for Visual Studio 2012 and 2013</a>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clone it!</p>

<p><code>git clone git@github.com:NuGet/NuGetGallery.git</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build it!</p>

<pre><code>cd NuGetGallery
.\build
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up the website in IIS Express!</p>

<ol class="task-list">
<li>We highly recommend using IIS Express. Use the <a href="http://microsoft.com/web">Web Platform Installer</a> to install it if you don't have it already (it comes with recent versions of VS and WebMatrix though)</li>
<li>In an ADMIN powershell prompt, run the .\tools\Enable-LocalTestMe.ps1 file. It allows non-admins to host websites at: <a href="http://nuget.localtest.me">http://nuget.localtest.me</a>, it configures an IIS Express site at that URL and creates a self-signed SSL certificate. For more information on localtest.me, check out <a href="http://readme.localtest.me">readme.localtest.me</a>
</li>
<li>If you're having trouble, go to the Project Properties for the Website project, click on the Web tab and change the URL to localhost:port where <em>port</em> is some port number above 1024.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the Database!</p>

<ol class="task-list">
<li>Open Visual Studio 2013</li>
<li>Open the Package Manager Console window</li>
<li>Ensure that the Default Project is set to <code>NuGetGallery</code>
</li>
<li>Open the NuGetGallery.sln solution from the root of this repository. <strong><em>Important:</em></strong> Make sure the Package Manager Console has been opened once before you open the solution. If the solution was already open, open the package manager console and then close and re-open the solution (from the file menu)</li>
<li>
<p>Run the following command in the Package Manager Console:</p>

<pre><code>Update-Database
</code></pre>

<p>If this fails, you are likely to get more useful output by passing -Debug than -Verbose.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Change the value of Gallery.ConfirmEmailAddresses to false in Web.Config file under src\NuGetGallery, this is required to upload the packages after registration.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the 'NuGetGallery' project (under the Frontend folder) is set to the Startup Project</p></li>
</ol><p>That's it! You should now be able to press Ctrl-F5 to run the site!</p>

<a name="user-content-the-git-workflow" class="anchor" href="#the-git-workflow" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Git Workflow</h2>

<p>This is the Git workflow we're currently using:</p>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-setting-up" class="anchor" href="#setting-up" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setting up</h3>

<ol class="task-list">
<li>Clone and checkout the following branches (to make sure local copies are made): 'master', 'iter-start'</li>
</ol><h3>
<a name="user-content-when-starting-a-new-featureunit-of-work" class="anchor" href="#when-starting-a-new-featureunit-of-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>When starting a new feature/unit of work.</h3>

<ol class="task-list">
<li>
<p><strong>Pull the latest.</strong>
Begin by pulling to make sure you are up-to-date before creating a branch to do your work 
This assumes you have no local commits that haven't yet been pushed (i.e., that you were 
previously up-to-date with origin).</p>

<pre><code>git checkout iter-start
git pull iter-start
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a topic branch to do your work.</strong>
You must work in topic branches, in order to help us keep our features isolated and easily moved between branches.
Our policy is to start all topic branches off of the 'iter-start' branch. 
Branch names should use the following format '[user]-[bugnumber]-[shortdescription]'. If there is no bug yet, 
create one and assign it to yourself!</p>

<pre><code>git checkout iter-start
git checkout -b anurse-123-makesuckless
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do your work.</strong>
Now, do your work using the following highly accurate and efficient algorithm :)</p>

<ol class="task-list">
<li>Make changes.</li>
<li>Test your changes (you're practicing TDD, right?)</li>
<li>
<p>Add your changes to git's index.</p>

<pre><code>git add -A
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commit your changes.</p>

<pre><code>git commit -m "&lt;description of work&gt;"
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>if (moreWorkToDo) go to #3.1 else go to #4.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Start a code review.</strong>
Start a code review by pushing your branch up to GitHub (<code>git push origin anurse-123-makesuckless</code>) and 
creating a Pull Request from your branch to <strong><em>master</em></strong>. Wait for at least someone on the team to respond with: "<img class="emoji" title=":shipit:" alt=":shipit:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/shipit.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle">" (that's called the
"Ship-It Squirrel" and you can put it in your own comments by typing <code>:shipit:</code>).</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Merge your changes in to master.</strong>
Click the bright green "Merge" button on your pull request! <strong>NOTE: DO NOT DELETE THE TOPIC BRANCH!!</strong></p>

<p>If there isn't a bright green button... well, you'll have to do some more complicated merging:</p>

<pre><code>git checkout master
git pull origin master
git merge anurse-123-makesuckless
... resolve conflicts ...
git push origin master
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Be ready to guide your change through QA, Staging and Prod</strong>
Your change will make its way through the QA, Staging and finally Prod branches as it's deployed to the various environments. Be prepared to fix additional bugs!</p></li>
</ol><p><strong>NOTE: DO NOT DELETE THE TOPIC BRANCH!!</strong></p></article></div>
