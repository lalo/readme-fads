<p>The C5 library is a set of generic collection classes (or container
classes) for the C# programming language and other generics-enabled
languages on version 4.0 of the CLI platform, as implemented by Microsoft
.NET and Mono.</p>

<p>The C5 library provides a wide range of classic data structures, rich
funcionality, the best possible asymptotic time complexity, documented
performance, and a thoroughly tested implementation.</p>

<a name="user-content-goals-of-the-c5-library" class="anchor" href="#goals-of-the-c5-library" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals of the C5 library</h2>

<p>The overall goal is for C5 to be a generic collection library for the C#
programming language and the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) whose 
functionality, efficiency and quality meets or exeeds what is available for
similar contemporary programming platforms.</p>

<p>The design has been influenced by the collection libraries for Java and
SmallTalk and the published critique of these.</p>

<p>However, it contains functionality and a regularity of design that
considerably exceeds that of the standard libraries for those languages.</p>

<a name="user-content-why-yet-another-generic-collection-library" class="anchor" href="#why-yet-another-generic-collection-library" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why yet another generic collection library</h2>

<p>There are already other generic collection libraries for C#/CLI, including
the System.Collections.Generic namespace introduced with .NET 2.0 and
Wintellect's  Power Collections for .NET by Peter Golde (<a href="http://powercollections.codeplex.com">powercollections.codeplex.com</a>/).</p>

<p>The CLI generic collection library as implemented by in Microsoft .NET
Framework 2.0 provides a limited choice of data structures.</p>

<p>In general, the CLI Framework library has a proliferation of methods
variants and  rather poor orthogonality.</p>

<p>Collection implementations such as array lists and linked lists have much
the same functionality but do not implement a common interface. This
impairs the learnability  of the library in contexts where nano-second
efficiency is more important that rich functionality, and the need to
support also rather resource-constrained run-time systems.</p>

<p>The Power Collections library by Peter Golde augments the CLI version 2.0
collection library with various data structures and algorithms.</p>

<p>However, it accepts the basic design of the CLI collection classes and
therefore suffers from some of the same shortcommings, and also does not
provide most of the advanced functionality (updatable views, snapshots,
directed enumeration, priority  queue handles, …) of C5.</p>

<p>Thus, in our opinion, C5 provides the most powerful, well-structured and
scalable generic collections library available for C#/CLI.</p>

<p>This is not entirely clear, but it may stand for <em>Copenhagen
Comprehensive Collection Classes for C#</em>, although the library may be
used from VB.NET, F# and other CLI languages, not just C#. It has nothing
to do with a Microsoft Dynamics product that used to be called Concorde
C5/Damgaard C5/Navision C5, nor a  real-time operation system called C5 (or
Chorus), nor the C5 Corporation (system visualization), nor an Eclipse
plug-in called C5, nor with cars such as the Citroën  C5 or Corvette C5 or
Clive Sinclair's ill-fated C5 concept vehicle.</p>

<p>The name may be inspired by the versatile C4 plastic explosive known from
e.g. James Bond movies.</p>

<a name="user-content-state-of-completion" class="anchor" href="#state-of-completion" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>State of completion</h2>

<p>At the time of writing, library design and implementation are complete, and
extensive unit tests have been written and applied systematically.</p>

<p>Most of the library API documentation is in place but requires
proof-reading.</p>

<p>The C5 implementation was originally built on .NET 2.0 and has only
recently been  upgraded to .NET 4.0. It does not (yet) use a great number
of the new features  introduced with C# 3 and 4, notably LINQ and covariant
and contravariant type parameters.</p>

<p>C5 is a portable library supporting .NET 4.0, Silverlight, Windows Phone 8,
and Mono.</p>

<a name="user-content-getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Get C5 from <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/C5">NuGet</a>:
<tt>PM&gt; Install-Package C5</tt></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C5 is built using the Portable Library Tools extension  (<a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/b0e0b5e9-e138-410b-ad10-00cb3caf4981">visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/b0e0b5e9-e138-410b-ad10-00cb3caf4981</a>)
this extension is required to open the C5.csproj in Visual Studio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documentation can be built using Sandcastle (<a href="http://sandcastle.codeplex.com">sandcastle.codeplex.com</a>/) and
Sandcastle Help File Builder (<a href="http://shfb.codeplex.com">shfb.codeplex.com</a>/), and the
<tt>C5.shfbproj</tt> file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building the unit test project requires NUnit. If you have NuGet installed
it  should automatically add the reference.</p>

<p>To run the tests, start NUnit, open project
C5/C5.Tests/bin/Debug/C5.Tests.dll,  press Run.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can install either ReSharper or the NUnit Test Adapter
for  Visual Studio 2012 and 2013 (<a href="http://nunit.org/index.php?p=vsTestAdapter&amp;r=2.6.2">nunit.org/index.php?p=vsTestAdapter&amp;r=2.6.2</a>)
and run the tests from inside Visual Studio.</p>

<p>There are more than 1430 NUnit test cases which should execute in less than
30 seconds. All should pass.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Open C5.csproj with Xamarin Studio (Mono 3.0) to build C5.dll or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build manually using <tt>xbuild C5.Mono.csproj</tt>.</p>
