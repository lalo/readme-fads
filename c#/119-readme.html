<p>Reviewing the CQRS Journey guidance and code, asking and answering questions, reporting bugs and making feature requests are critical activities of the project community: we value your feedback!</p>

<p>In order to become familiar with the functionality of the reference implementation you can obtain the source code from GitHub (see "<a href="#obtainsource">Obtaining the source code</a>" below) and compile it locally. While you become familiar with the functionality, you can report bugs or request new features (see "<a href="#reportbugs">Report bugs and request features</a>" below).   You can also download the current draft of the documentation from GitHub.</p>

<p>We would love to hear your thoughts, be it comments, suggestions, ideas or anything else. However, in the end we are creating Microsoft guidance. So we'll happily take your feedback but you need to understand that by providing us feedback in any form you are agreeing that (i) we may freely use, disclose, reproduce, modify, license, distribute and otherwise commercialize your feedback in  any Microsoft product, technology, service, specification or other documentation, (ii) others may use, disclose, reproduce, license, distribute and otherwise commercialize your feedback in connection with our products and services, and (iii) you will not be compensated for any of these things. We may incorporate ideas or make changes based on comments you make, or we may make changes to the product that are indirectly influenced by discussions that we have with you and other folks in the community. </p>

<p>In order to become a contributor to the project you must sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Signing the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) does not grant you rights to commit to the source code or doc repositories but it does mean that we will consider your contributions and you will get credit for them if we use them. </p>

<p>You can download the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) by clicking the following link: <a href="http://cqrsjourney.github.com/docs/Contribution%20License%20Agreement.pdf">http://cqrsjourney.github.com/docs/Contribution%20License%20Agreement.pdf</a>. Please fill in, sign, scan and email it to <a href="mailto:cla@microsoft.com">cla@microsoft.com</a> with the "CQRS Journey Project CLA" as the subject line.</p>

<p>You do not need to sign a separate agreement if you have already submitted one to contribute to the project's documentation or to other Microsoft OSS projects (such as Windows Azure SDK) and if your employer hasn't changed.</p>

<p>In order to obtain the source code you need to become familiar with Git (see <a href="http://progit.org/book/">http://progit.org/book/</a>) and GitHub (see <a href="http://help.github.com/">http://help.github.com/</a>) and you need to have Git installed on your local machine. </p>

<p>You can obtain the source code from GitHub by following the following steps on your local machine:</p>

<ol class="task-list">
<li> Go to <a href="https://github.com/mspnp/cqrs-journey-code">https://github.com/mspnp/cqrs-journey-code</a>

<li> Select the Fork button and choose your own GitHub account as target </li>
<li> Clone the repository on your local machine with the following Git command<br><code>git clone git@github.com:[USERNAME]/cqrs-journey-code</code>
</li>
<li> Add a remote to your local repository using the following Git commands<br><code>cd cqrs-journey-code</code><br><code>git remote add upstream git@github.com:mspnp/cqrs-journey-code</code>

<p>We are using the <a href="http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/">Fork+Pull Model</a> of collaborative development.</p>

<p>You make modifications of the code and commit them in your local Git repository. Once you are done with your implementation follow the steps below:</p>

<ol class="task-list">
<li> Change the working branch to dev with the following command<br><code>git checkout dev</code>
</li>
<li> Submit the changes to your own fork in GitHub by using the following command<br><code>git push</code>
</li>
<li> In GitHub create new pull request by clicking on the Pull Request button<br>
</li>
<li> In the pull request select your fork as the head and mspnp/cqrs-journey-code as base for the request </li>
<li> Write detailed message describing the changes in the pull request </li>
<li> Submit the pull request for consideration by the core team </li>
</ol><p><strong>Note:</strong> It's a good idea to create a branch before submitting a pull request, just in case there are improvement suggestions to the submitted contribution that need to be incorporated before it's accepted. That way, the pull request points to the entire branch and changes to it can be incorporated using the same pull request sent initially (which will hold discussions and comments about the improvements, etc.).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> All changes and pull request should be done against the <code>dev</code> branch. Changes will be integrated in the <code>master</code> branch by the core team.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that not all requests will be approved. Requests are reviewed by the core team on a regular basis and will be updated with the status at each review. If your request is rejected you will receive information about the reasons why it was rejected.</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>For every new code file, include the file header with license information that is included in all other files (see <a href="https://github.com/mspnp/cqrs-journey-code/blob/dev/source/CQRS-journey.licenseheader">https://github.com/mspnp/cqrs-journey-code/blob/dev/source/CQRS-journey.licenseheader</a>, for example).</li>
<li>You have properly documented any new functionality using the documentation standards for the language (this includes classes, methods and functions, properties etc.). For any change you make proper inline documentation is included.</li>
<li>For any new functionality or updates, you have written complete unit tests.</li>
<li>You have run all unit tests and they pass.</li>
<li>You have run the Stylecop and most default rules are satisfied.</li>
<li>Code should fit into the overall structure of the project and style of the existing codebase.</li>
</ul><p>In order to speed up the process of accepting your contributions, you should try to make your check-ins as small as possible, avoid any unnecessary deltas and the need to rebase.</p>
