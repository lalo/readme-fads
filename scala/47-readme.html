<p>ScalaCheck is a library written in <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> and 
used for automated property-based testing of Scala or Java programs.
ScalaCheck was originally inspired by the Haskell library
<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck">QuickCheck</a>, but has also
ventured into its own.</p>

<p>ScalaCheck has no external dependencies other than the Scala runtime, and 
<a href="/download.html#sbt">works</a> great with <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/">sbt</a>, the 
Scala build tool. It is also fully integrated in the test frameworks
<a href="http://www.scalatest.org/">ScalaTest</a> and 
<a href="http://etorreborre.github.com/specs2/">specs2</a>. You can of course also use 
ScalaCheck completely standalone, with its built-in test runner.</p>

<p>ScalaCheck is used by several prominent Scala projects, for example the <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala
compiler</a> and the <a href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a>
concurrency framework.</p>
