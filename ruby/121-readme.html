<p>Betty is a friendly English-like interface for your command line.</p>

<p>She translates English-like phrases into commands in case you ever run into situations <a href="http://xkcd.com/1168/">like this</a>.</p>

<p>This means you don't have to leave your command line to look up an obscure but useful command. Just ask Betty!</p>
