<p>Logstash is a tool for managing events and logs. You can use it to collect
logs, parse them, and store them for later use (like, for searching). Speaking
of searching, Logstash comes with a web interface for searching and drilling
into all of your logs.</p>

<p>It is fully free and fully open source. The license is Apache 2.0, meaning you
are pretty much free to use it however you want in whatever way.</p>

<p>For more info, see <a href="http://logstash.net/">http://logstash.net/</a></p>

<p>Since version 1.4.0 of Logstash, some of the community-contributed plugins were
moved to a new home in the
<a href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash-contrib">Elasticsearch logstash-contrib repo</a>.
If you can't find a plugin here which you've previously used, odds are it is now
located there. The good news is that these plugins are simple to install using the
<a href="http://logstash.net/docs/latest/contrib-plugins">Logstash manual plugin installation script</a>.</p>

<p>Need help? Try #logstash on freenode irc or the <a href="mailto:logstash-users@googlegroups.com">logstash-users@googlegroups.com</a>
mailing list.</p>

<p>You can also find documentation on the <a href="http://logstash.net">http://logstash.net</a> site.</p>

<a name="user-content-developing" class="anchor" href="#developing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Developing</h2>

<p>Here's how to get started:</p>

<pre><code># Install jruby
make vendor-jruby
</code></pre>

<p>Now install dependencies:</p>

<pre><code># Install logstash ruby dependencies
bin/logstash deps
</code></pre>

<p>Other commands:</p>

<pre><code># to use Logstash gems or libraries in irb, use the following
# this gets you an 'irb' shell with Logstash's environment
bin/logstash irb

# Run Logstash
bin/logstash agent [options]

# If running bin/logstash agent yields complaints about log4j/other things
# This will download the elasticsearch jars so Logstash can use them.
make vendor-elasticsearch
</code></pre>

<p>Notes about using other rubies. If you don't use rvm, you can probably skip this paragraph. Logstash works with other rubies, and if you wish to use your own ruby instead of the JRuby the Makefile gives you, you must set <code>USE_RUBY=1</code> in your environment.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-testing" class="anchor" href="#testing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Testing</h2>

<p>There are a few ways to run the tests. For development, using <code>bin/logstash
rspec &lt;some spec&gt;</code> will suffice:</p>

<pre><code>% bin/logstash rspec spec/filters/grok.rb
...................

Finished in 0.123 seconds
19 examples, 0 failures
</code></pre>

<p>Alternately, if you have just built the tarball, you can run the tests
specifically on those like so:</p>

<pre><code>make tarball-test
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to run all the tests from source, do:</p>

<pre><code>make test
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-building" class="anchor" href="#building" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building</h2>

<p>Building is not required. You are highly recommended to download the releases
we provide from the Logstash site!</p>

<p>If you want to build the release tarball yourself, run:</p>

<pre><code>make tarball
</code></pre>

<p>You can build rpms and debs, if you need those. Building rpms requires you have <a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm">fpm</a>, then do this:</p>

<pre><code>make package
</code></pre>

<li>Community: If a newbie has a bad time, it's a bug.</li>

<p>All contributions are welcome: ideas, patches, documentation, bug reports,
complaints, and even something you drew up on a napkin.</p>

<p>Programming is not a required skill. Whatever you've seen about open source and
maintainers or community members  saying "send patches or die" - you will not
see that here.</p>

<p>It is more important to me that you are able to contribute.</p>
