<div class="announce instapaper_body md" data-path="README.md" id="readme"><article class="markdown-body entry-content" itemprop="mainContentOfPage"><p>Deployment system for web applications, originally intended for hosting Yesod
applications. Keter does the following actions for your application:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Binds to the main port (usually port 80) and reverse proxies requests to your application based on virtual hostnames.</li>
<li>Provides SSL support if requested.</li>
<li>Automatically launches applications, monitors processes, and relaunches any processes which die.</li>
<li>Provides graceful redeployment support, but launching a second copy of your application, performing a health check, and then switching reverse proxying to the new process.</li>
<li>Management of log files.</li>
</ul><p>Keter provides many more advanced features and extension points. It allows
configuration of static hosts, redirect rules, management of PostgreSQL
databases, and more. It supports a simple bundle format for applications which
allows for easy management of your web apps.</p>

<a name="user-content-quick-start" class="anchor" href="#quick-start" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quick Start</h2>

<p>Do get Keter up-and-running quickly on an Ubuntu system, run:</p>

<pre><code>wget -O - https://raw.github.com/snoyberg/keter/master/setup-keter.sh | bash
</code></pre>

<p>(Note: you may need to run the above command twice, if the shell exits after
<code>apt-get</code> but before running the rest of its instructions.) This will download
and build Keter from source and get it running with a
default configuration.</p>

<p><em>This approach is not recommended for a production system</em>. We do not recommend
installing a full GHC toolchain on a production server, nor running such ad-hoc
scripts. This is intended to provide a quick way to play with Keter, especially
for temporary virtual machines. For a production system, we recommend building
the <code>keter</code> binary on a separate system, and tracking it via a package manager
or similar strategy.</p>

<a name="user-content-bundling-your-app-for-keter" class="anchor" href="#bundling-your-app-for-keter" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bundling your app for Keter</h2>

<ol class="task-list">
<li><p>Modify your web app to check for the <code>PORT</code> environment variable, and have
it listen for incoming HTTP requests on that port. Keter automatically
assigns arbitrary ports to each web app it manages. The Yesod scaffold
site is already equipped to read the <code>PORT</code> environment variable when
it is set.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Create a file <code>config/keter.yaml</code>. The minimal file just has two settings:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-yaml"><pre><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">exec</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">../path/to/executable</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">host</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">mydomainname.example.com</span>
</pre></div>

<p>See the bundles section below for more available settings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a gzipped tarball with the <code>config/keter.yaml</code> file, your
executable, and any other static resources you would like available to your
application. This file should be given a <code>.keter</code> file extension, e.g.
<code>myapp.keter</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the <code>.keter</code> file to <code>/opt/keter/incoming</code>. Keter will monitor this
directory for file updates, and automatically redeploy new versions of your
bundle.</p></li>
</ol><h2>
<a name="user-content-setup" class="anchor" href="#setup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setup</h2>

<p>Instructions are for an Ubuntu system. Eventually, I hope to provide a PPA for
this (please contact me if you would like to assist with this). For now, the
following steps should be sufficient:</p>

<p>First, install PostgreSQL</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install postgresql
</code></pre>

<p>Second, build the <code>keter</code> binary and place it at <code>/opt/keter/bin</code>. To do so,
you'll need to install the Haskell Platform, and can then build with <code>cabal</code>.
This would look something like:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install haskell-platform
cabal update
cabal install keter
sudo mkdir -p /opt/keter/bin
sudo cp ~/.cabal/bin/keter /opt/keter/bin
</code></pre>

<p>Third, create a Keter config file. You can view a sample at
<a href="https://github.com/snoyberg/keter/blob/master/etc/keter-config.yaml">https://github.com/snoyberg/keter/blob/master/etc/keter-config.yaml</a>.</p>

<p>Fourth, set up an Upstart job to start <code>keter</code> when your system boots.</p>

<pre><code># /etc/init/keter.conf
start on (net-device-up and local-filesystems and runlevel [2345])
stop on runlevel [016]
respawn

console none

exec /opt/keter/bin/keter /opt/keter/etc/keter-config.yaml
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, start the job for the first time:</p>

<pre><code>sudo start keter
</code></pre>

<p>Optionally, you may wish to change the owner on the <code>/opt/keter/incoming</code>
folder to your user account, so that you can deploy without <code>sudo</code>ing.</p>

<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /opt/keter/incoming
sudo chown $USER /opt/keter/incoming
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-bundles" class="anchor" href="#bundles" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bundles</h2>

<p>An application needs to be set up as a keter bundle. This is a GZIPed tarball
with a <code>.keter</code> filename extension and which has one special file:
<code>config/keter.yaml</code>. A sample file is available at
<a href="https://github.com/snoyberg/keter/blob/master/incoming/foo1_0/config/keter.yaml">https://github.com/snoyberg/keter/blob/master/incoming/foo1_0/config/keter.yaml</a>.</p>

<p>Keter as well supports wildcard subdomains and exceptions, as in this example
configuration:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-yaml"><pre><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">exec</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">../com.example.app</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">args</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">Hello</span>
    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">World</span>
    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">1</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">host</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">www.example.com</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">extra-hosts</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="s">"*.example.com"</span>
    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">foo.bar.example.com</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">static-hosts</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">host</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">static.example.com</span>
      <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">root</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">../static</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">redirects</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">from</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">example.com</span>
      <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">to</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">www.example.com</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Due to YAML parsing, wildcard hostnames will need to be quoted as above.
Wildcard hostnames are not recursive, so <code>foo.bar.example.com</code> must be
explicitly added as an extra hostname in the above example, or
alternatively, <code>*.*.example.com</code> would cover all host names two levels
deep. It would not cover host names only one level deep, such as
<code>qux.example.com</code>. In this manner, wildcard hostnames correspond to the
manner in which SSL certificates are handled per RFC2818. Wildcards may
be used in only one level of a hostname, as in <code>foo.*.example.com</code>.</p>

<p>Full RFC2818 compliance is not present - <code>f*.example.com</code> will not be
handled as a wildcard with a prefix.</p>

<p>A sample Bash script for producing a Keter bundle is:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-bash"><pre><span class="c">#!/bin/bash -ex</span>

cabal build
strip dist/build/yesodweb/yesodweb
rm -rf static/tmp
tar czfv yesodweb.keter dist/build/yesodweb/yesodweb config static
</pre></div>

<p>For users of Yesod, The <code>yesod</code> executable provides a <code>keter</code> command for
creating the bundle, and the scaffolded site provides a <code>keter.yaml</code> file.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-deploying" class="anchor" href="#deploying" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Deploying</h2>

<p>In order to deploy, you simply copy the keter bundle to <code>/opt/keter/incoming</code>.
To update an app, copy in the new version. The old process will only be
terminated after the new process has started answering requests. To stop an
application, delete the file from incoming.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-postgresql-support" class="anchor" href="#postgresql-support" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PostgreSQL support</h2>

<p>Keter ships by default with a PostgreSQL plugin, which will handle management of PostgreSQL databases for your application. To use this, make the following changes:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Add <code>postgres: true</code> to your <code>config/keter.yaml</code> file.</li>
<li>
<p>Modify your application to get its database connection settings from the following environment variables:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><code>PGHOST</code></li>
<li><code>PGPORT</code></li>
<li><code>PGUSER</code></li>
<li><code>PGPASS</code></li>
<li><code>PGDATABASE</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The Yesod scaffold site is already equipped to read these environment
variables when they are set.</p></li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="user-content-known-issues" class="anchor" href="#known-issues" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Known issues</h2>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>
<p>There are reports of Keter not working behind an nginx reverse proxy. From
the reports, this appears to be a limitation in nginx's implementation, not a
problem with Keter. Keter works fine behind other reverse proxies, including
Apache and Amazon ELB.</p>

<p>One possible workaround is to add the following lines to your nginx configuration:</p>

<pre><code>proxy_set_header Connection "";
proxy_http_version 1.1;
</code></pre>

<p>This has not yet been confirmed to work in production. If you use this,
please report either its success or failure back to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keter does not handle password-protected SSL key files well.  When provided
with such a key file, unlike Apache and Nginx, Keter will not pause to ask
for the password.  Instead, your https connections will merely stall.</p>

<p>To get around this, you need to create a copy of the key without password
and deploy this new key:</p>

<pre><code>openssl rsa -in original.key -out new.key
</code></pre>

<p>(Back up the original key first, just in case.)</p>
</li>
