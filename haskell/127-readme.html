<div class="announce instapaper_body md" data-path="README.md" id="readme"><article class="markdown-body entry-content" itemprop="mainContentOfPage"><p>This is a desktop information bar intended for use with XMonad and
similar window managers.  It is similar in spirit to xmobar; it is
different in that it gives up some simplicity for a reasonable helping
of eye candy.  This bar is based on GTK+ (via gtk2hs) and uses fancy
graphics where doing so is reasonable and useful.</p>

<p>The bar is configured much like XMonad.  It uses
~/.config/taffybar/taffybar.hs as its configuration file.  This file
is just a Haskell program that invokes the real <em>main</em> function with a
configuration object.  The configuration file basically just specifies
which widgets to use, though any arbitrary Haskell code can be
executed before the bar is created.</p>

<p>There are some generic pre-defined widgets available:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Graph (modeled after the graph widget in Awesome)</li>
<li>Vertical bar (also similar to a widget in Awesome)</li>
<li>Periodically-updating labels, graphs, and vertical bars</li>
</ul><p>There are also several more specialized widgets:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Battery widget</li>
<li>Textual clock</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org notifications (via dbus)</li>
<li>MPRIS1 and MPRIS2 widgets</li>
<li>Weather widget</li>
<li>XMonad log widget (listens on dbus instead of stdin)</li>
<li>System tray</li>
</ul><h1>

<p>An incomplete list of things that would be cool to have:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>xrandr widget (for dealing changing clone/extend mode and orientation)</li>
<li>Better behavior when adding/removing monitors (never tried it)</li>
<li>Make MPRIS more configurable</li>
</ul></article></div>
