<h1>
<a name="user-content-what-is-cryptol" class="anchor" href="#what-is-cryptol" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Cryptol?</h1>

<p>The Cryptol specification language was designed by Galois for the
NSA's Trusted Systems Research Group as a public standard for
specifying cryptographic algorithms. A Cryptol reference specification
can serve as the formal documentation for a cryptographic module.
Unlike current specification mechanisms, Cryptol is fully executable,
allowing designers to experiment with their programs incrementally as
their designs evolve.</p>

<p>This release is an interpreter for version 2 of the Cryptol
language. The interpreter includes a <code>:check</code> command, which tests
predicates written in Cryptol against randomly-generated test vectors
(in the style of
<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck">QuickCheck</a>. There is
also a <code>:prove</code> command, which calls out to SMT solvers, such as
Yices, Z3, or CVC4, to prove predicates for all possible inputs.</p>

<a name="user-content-getting-cryptol-binaries" class="anchor" href="#getting-cryptol-binaries" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Cryptol Binaries</h1>

<p>Cryptol binaries for Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows are available from
the GitHub
<a href="https://github.com/GaloisInc/cryptol/releases">releases page</a>. Mac OS
X and Linux binaries are distributed as a tarball which you can
extract to a location of your choice. Windows binaries are distributed
as an <code>.msi</code> installer package which places a shortcut to the Cryptol
interpreter in the Start menu.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-getting-cvc4" class="anchor" href="#getting-cvc4" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting CVC4</h2>

<p>Cryptol currently depends on the
<a href="http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/">CVC4 SMT solver</a> to solve constraints during
type checking, and as the default solver for the <code>:sat</code> and <code>:prove</code>
commands. You can download CVC4 binaries for a variety of platforms
from their <a href="http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/downloads/">download page</a>.</p>

<a name="user-content-building-cryptol-from-source" class="anchor" href="#building-cryptol-from-source" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building Cryptol From Source</h1>

<p>In addition to the binaries, the Cryptol source is available publicly
on <a href="https://github.com/GaloisInc/cryptol">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Cryptol builds and runs on various flavors of Linux, Mac OS X, and
Windows. We regularly build and test it in the following environments:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Mac OS X 10.9 64-bit</li>
<li>CentOS 5 32/64-bit</li>
<li>CentOS 6 32/64-bit</li>
<li>Windows XP 32-bit</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="user-content-prerequisites" class="anchor" href="#prerequisites" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Cryptol is developed using GHC 7.6.3 and cabal-install 1.18. While you
can install these independently, the easiest way to get the correct
versions is to:</p>

<ol class="task-list">
<li>
<p>Install <a href="http://www.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell Platform 2013.2.0.0</a></p>

<p><strong>Mac Users</strong>: the current version of the Haskell Platform has
some incompatibilities with Mac OS X 10.9; it is easier to install
GHC, cabal-install, alex, and happy from
<a href="https://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> or
<a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Run <code>cabal update</code></p></li>
<li><p>Run <code>cabal install cabal-install</code></p></li>
<li><p>Add cabal-install's binary path to your <code>PATH</code> variable (usually <code>~/.cabal/bin</code>)</p></li>
</ol><p>Some supporting non-Haskell libraries are required to build
Cryptol. Most should already be present for your operating system, but
you may need to install the following:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><a href="https://gmplib.org/">The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/">ncurses</a></li>
</ul><p>You'll also need <a href="#getting-cvc4">CVC4</a> installed when running Cryptol.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-building-cryptol" class="anchor" href="#building-cryptol" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building Cryptol</h2>

<p>From the Cryptol source directory, run:</p>

<pre><code>make
</code></pre>

<p>This will build Cryptol in place. From there, there are additional targets:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>
<code>make test</code>: run the regression test suite (note: 4 failures is expected)</li>
<li>
<code>make docs</code>: build the Cryptol documentation (requires
<a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a> and
<a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live</a>)</li>
<li>
<code>make tarball</code>: build a tarball with a relocatable Cryptol binary and documentation</li>
<li>
<code>make dist</code>: build a platform-specific distribution. On all
platforms except Windows, this is currently equivalent to <code>make
tarball</code>. On Windows, this will build an <code>.msi</code> package using
<a href="http://wixtoolset.org/">WiX Toolset 3.7</a>, which must be installed
separately.</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="user-content-installing-cryptol" class="anchor" href="#installing-cryptol" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing Cryptol</h2>

<p>Aside from the <code>docs</code> target, these will leave you with a Cryptol
binary at <code>.cabal-sandbox/bin/cryptol</code> in your source directory. You
can either use that binary directly, or use the results of <code>tarball</code>
or <code>dist</code> to install Cryptol in a location of your choice.</p>

<h1>
<a name="user-content-checking-your-installation" class="anchor" href="#checking-your-installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Checking your Installation</h1>

<p>Run Cryptol, and at the prompt type:</p>

<pre><code>Cryptol&gt; :prove True
</code></pre>

<p>If Cryptol responds</p>

<pre><code>Q.E.D.
</code></pre>

<p>then Cryptol is installed correctly. If it prints something like</p>

<pre><code>*** An error occurred.
***  Unable to locate executable for cvc4
***  Executable specified: "cvc4"
</code></pre>

<p>then make sure you've installed <a href="#getting-cvc4">CVC4</a>, and that the
binary is on your <code>PATH</code>.</p>

<p>As noted above, <code>make test</code> currently results in four failures. An issue has been filed on GitHub for each of them.</p>

<a name="user-content-where-to-look-next" class="anchor" href="#where-to-look-next" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where to Look Next</h1>

<p>The <code>docs</code> directory of the installation package contains an
introductory book, the <code>examples</code> directory contains a number of
algorithms specified in Cryptol.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with version 1 of Cryptol, you should read the
<code>Version2Changes</code> document in the <code>docs</code> directory.</p>

<p>Cryptol is still under active development at Galois. We are also
building tools that consume both Cryptol specifications and
implementations in (for example) C or Java, and can (with some amount
of work) allow you to verify that an implementation meets its
specification. Email us at <a href="mailto:cryptol@galois.com">cryptol@galois.com</a> if you're interested
in these capabilities.</p>

<h1>
<a name="user-content-thanks" class="anchor" href="#thanks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Thanks!</h1>

<p>We hope that Cryptol is useful as a tool for educators and students,
commercial and open source authors of cryptographic implementations,
and by cryptographers to</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>specify cryptographic algorithms</li>
<li>check or prove properties of algorithms</li>
<li>generate test vectors for testing implementations</li>
<li>experiment with new algorithms</li>
