<p>If you want to submit a fix for a typo or fix for code then just submit a pull request, and I'm happy to
recompile the resulting document.</p>

<p>If for some reason you want to compile the HTML page yourself, then you'll need to compile the preprocesor
against Pandoc and then run make to build the page.</p>
