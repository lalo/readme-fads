<p>wisp is a tiny interpreted lisp written is haskell &amp; easily embedded into larger haskell programs, e.g., as a scripting language. it includes a superset of the following features:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>full lexical closures</li>
<li>tail-call optimization</li>
<li>macros</li>
<li>first-class continuations</li>
<li>pattern matching (on lists)</li>
<li>automatic currying</li>
</ul><h1>

<p>wisp lives in the ST (optionally IO) monad. separate interpreters with completely segregated environments can be run concurrently. wisp has a few IO facilities, but they're completely sandboxed and can't accidentally affect the host program or environment.</p></article></div>
