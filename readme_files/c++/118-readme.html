<p>pgModeler - PostgreSQL Database Modeler - is an open source data modeling tool designed for PostgreSQL. No more DDL commands written by hand let pgModeler do the job for you! This software reunites the concepts of entity-relationship diagrams and the features that PostgreSQL implements as extensions of SQL standards.</p>

<p>pgModeler grown bigger and reached a state that its lonely developer cannot handle all the modification and new feature requests as well to create a user's manual. So if you know C++ and Qt framework programming and wants to contribute with coding or an user's manual let me know! I'll be grateful for any help to the project!</p>

<a name="user-content-known-issues" class="anchor" href="#known-issues" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Known Issues</h2>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>pgModeler sometimes can crash during the export, import or validation process due to some threaded operations that, depending on size and arrange of the model, causes race conditions.</li>
<li>Due to particularities on executing bundles on MacOSX the file association does not work correctly on this system. So it's not possible to open a model file by clicking it on Finder.</li>
<li>To use pgmodeler-cli command on MacOSX you must call it by executing the following command inside the "pgmodeler.app/Contents/MacOS" path: <code>./startapp pgmodeler-cli [PARAMS]</code>
</li>
