<a name="user-content-status" class="anchor" href="#status" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Status</h2>

<p>Code is a bit of a mess and it's not fully functional yet, I still need to implement
some functions and add a upnp lib(really important for people with routers).</p>

<p>I did test it with some games(emulator &lt;-&gt; real psp with the server running locally)
and it's looking good:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Worms Open Warfare: Ran just fine, I was able to play a whole match without problems</li>
<li>Monster Hunter Freedom Unite: Runs fine too. Gathering Hall and embarking on quests works</li>
<li>Dissidia Duodecim 012: Doesn't work. It requires some functions that I haven't implemented
yet. Also, it uses a port &lt; 1000 and thats reserved for admin apps on linux, running the emu
as sudo "solves" it, but it's far from ideal.</li>
<li>Pacman World Rally: Works too.</li>
</ul><h2>
