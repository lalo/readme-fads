</h2>

<p>This is an early version of Brackets, a code editor for HTML, CSS
and JavaScript that's <em>built</em> in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. </p>

<p>What makes Brackets different from other web code editors?</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>
<strong>Tools shouldn't get in your way.</strong> Instead of cluttering up your coding
environment with lots of panels and icons, the Quick Edit UI in Brackets puts 
context-specific code and tools inline.</li>
<li>
<strong>Brackets is in sync with your browser.</strong> With Live Preview, Brackets
works directly with your browser to push code edits instantly and jump
back and forth between your real source code and the browser view.</li>
<li>
<strong>Do it yourself.</strong> Because Brackets is open source, and built with HTML, CSS
and JavaScript, you can <a href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">help build</a> the best code editor for the web.</li>
</ul><p>You can see some 
<a href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Screenshots">screenshots of Brackets</a>
on the wiki, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/CodeBrackets">intro videos</a> on YouTube, and news on the <a href="http://blog.brackets.io/">Brackets blog</a>.</p>

<p>Together with your contributions, we're getting close to our first release candidate.  What's there is reasonably stable, and the Brackets team even uses Brackets to develop Brackets full time. So feel free to give it a spin and let us know what's missing! Being built on JavaScript, it's easy to make your own changes, and we give priority to integrating your pull requests back into Brackets!</p>

<h4>
<a name="user-content-download" class="anchor" href="#download" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Download</h4>

<p>Installers for the latest stable build for Mac, Windows and Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) can be <a href="http://brackets.io/">downloaded here</a>.</p>

<p>The Linux version has most of the features of the Mac and Windows versions, but
is still missing a few things. See the <a href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Linux-Version">Linux wiki page</a>
for a list of known issues and to find out how you can help.</p>

<h4>
<a name="user-content-usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h4>

<p>By default, Brackets opens a folder containing some simple "Getting Started" content.
You can choose a different folder to edit using <em>File &gt; Open Folder</em>.</p>

<p>Most of Brackets should be pretty self-explanatory, but for information on how
to use its unique features, like Quick Edit and Live Preview, please read
<a href="http://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Use-Brackets">How to Use Brackets</a>. 
Also, see the <a href="http://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Release-Notes">release notes</a>
for a list of new features and known issues in each build.</p>

<p>In addition to the core features built into Brackets, there is a large and growing
community of developers building extensions that add all sorts of useful functionality.
See the <a href="https://brackets-registry.aboutweb.com/">Brackets Extension Registry</a>
for a list of available extensions. For installation instructions,
see the <a href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Extensions">extensions wiki page</a>.</p>

<p>If you found a repeatable bug, and <a href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a> 
tips didn't help, then be sure to <a href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues">search existing issues</a> first.
Include steps to consistently reproduce the problem, actual vs. expected results, screenshots, and your OS and
Brackets version number. Disable all extensions to verify the issue is a core Brackets bug.

<p>Awesome! <em>There are lots of ways you can help.</em> First read 
<a href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a>, 
then learn how to <a href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Hack-on-Brackets">pull the repo and hack on Brackets</a>.</p>

<p>The text editor inside Brackets is based on 
<a href="http://github.com/marijnh/CodeMirror">CodeMirror</a>â€”thanks to Marijn for
taking our pull requests, implementing feature requests and fixing bugs! See 
<a href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Notes-on-CodeMirror">Notes on CodeMirror</a>
for info on how we're using CodeMirror.</p>

<p>Although Brackets is built in HTML/CSS/JS, it currently runs as a desktop 
application in a thin native shell, so that it can access your local files.
(If you just try to open the index.html file in a browser, it won't work yet.)
The native shell for Brackets lives in a separate repo, 
<a href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets-shell/">adobe/brackets-shell</a>.</p>
