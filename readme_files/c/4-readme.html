<p>Online book about how to write a computer operating system in C/C++ from scratch.</p>

<p><strong>Caution</strong>: This repository is a remake of my old course. It was written several years ago <a href="https://github.com/SamyPesse/devos">as one of my first projects when I was in High School</a>, I'm still refactoring some parts. The original course was in French and I'm not an English native. I'm going to continue and improve this course in my free-time.</p>

<p><strong>Book</strong>: An online version is available at <a href="https://www.gitbook.io/book/SamyPesse/how-to-create-an-operating-system">https://www.gitbook.io/book/SamyPesse/how-to-create-an-operating-system</a> (PDF, Mobi and ePub). It was been generated using <a href="https://www.gitbook.io">GitBook</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Source Code</strong>: All the system source code will be stored in the <a href="https://github.com/SamyPesse/How-to-Make-a-Computer-Operating-System/tree/master/src">src</a> directory. Each step will contain links to the different related files.</p>

<p>The goal is to build a very simple UNIX-based operating system in C++, not just a "proof-of-concept". The OS should be able to boot, start a userland shell, and be extensible.</p>
