<p>Shoes is the best little DSL for cross-platform GUI programming there is. It feels like real Ruby, rather than just another C++ library wrapper. If Gtk or wxWidgets is Rails, Shoes is Sinatra.</p>

<p>Way way back in the day, there was a guy named _why. He created a project known as <a href="http://hackety-hack.com">Hackety Hack</a> to teach programming to everyone. In order to reach all corners of the earth, _why decided to make Hackety Hack work on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. This was a lot of work, and so _why decided to share his toolkit with the world. Thus, Shoes was born.</p>

<p>Everybody loved Shoes and many apps were made. But, one day, _why left. In his memory, Team Shoes assembled, and carried on making Shoes. They released Shoes 3 in late summer 2010.</p>

</h1>

<p>Due to various issues (including compilation/release, stability) with this shoes implementation development moved on to <a href="https://github.com/shoes/shoes4">shoes4</a>. Shoes4 is a complete all Ruby rewrite of shoes. It's goal is to be as close to 100% backwards compatible as it can get e.g. it implements the same DSL.</p>

<p>So what does that mean? Well we accept pull requests but are not actively developing/releasing this shoes version. Our development efforts are now concentrated on shoes4, which is shaping up to become the new default implementation. It is already quite far and a lot of things already work.</p>

<a name="user-content-using-shoes" class="anchor" href="#using-shoes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using Shoes</h1>

<p>If you'd like to use Shoes to develop some apps... awesome! It's super easy: Just go to the <a href="http://shoesrb.com/downloads">downloads page on the Shoes website</a> and download a copy of Shoes for your platform. Mac OSX, Windows, and Linux supported!</p>

<p>After you install Shoes, run it! You'll get a window like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/shoes/shoes/raw/develop/static/shoes_main_window.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://github.com/shoes/shoes/raw/develop/static/shoes_main_window.png" alt="shoes main window" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>

<p>You can then open any .rb file with Shoes code inside by choosing "Open an App." It'll open it up and run it, right away.</p>

<p>Once you're happy with your app, you can choose "Package an App" to wrap up your app as a .exe, .app, or a .run. Then you can share it with someone without a pair of Shoes to call their own.</p>

<p>You can make your own pair of Shoes with a little bit of elbow grease. Since there are different instructions on each platform, we've got a page up on the <a href="http://github.com/shoes/shoes/wiki">Shoes development wiki</a> about it. It's <a href="https://github.com/shoes/shoes/wiki/Building-Shoes">right here</a>.</p>
