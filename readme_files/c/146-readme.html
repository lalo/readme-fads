<a name="user-content-overview" class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>

<p>This is smartos-live, which builds a SmartOS platform image containing the
illumos core OS components; a set of "extra" mostly third-party software
required by illumos, by other SmartOS software, or for system management; a
collection of utilities comprising SmartOS-specific functionality
found in projects/local; and implementation-specific overlays that deliver
additional files verbatim.</p>

<p>The build process accumulates from those various components a set of objects
into a subdirectory of the smartos-live root.  This subdirectory is known as
the proto area and by default is named proto.  All objects that are
delivered by the platform are built against the contents of the proto area,
such that they use the interfaces defined by the headers and libraries
provided by the software being delivered rather than that installed on the
build system.  However, not all objects installed into the proto area are
delivered by the platform.  This allows objects in the platform to be built
correctly without forcing us to deliver private objects in the platform that
would conflict with objects delivered by pkgsrc into zones.</p>

<p>Each component (illumos, illumos-extra, illumos-live, and each subproject
and overlay) includes a manifest.  The manifest lists the files installed
into the proto area by that component that should be delivered by the
platform, along with its type, ownership, and permissions.  This includes
directories and symlinks; simply creating a directory or symlink in the
proto area does not result in that object being delivered by the program.
This also means that symlinks in the proto area can be broken without
obvious effects on the platform image, which is usually a bug and can result
in silent (and not-so-silent) build problems.</p>

<p>The manifests are aggregated and the resulting list of objects assembled
into lofi filesystems created in /tmp, which in turn are assembled into the
platform image itself.  This process is performed mainly by the
tools/build_live script.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-tools" class="anchor" href="#tools" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tools</h2>

<p>As of June 2012, the Sun Studio compiler should no longer be executed as
part of the build process.  However, it is still used for building lint
libraries and for linting illumos.  Hopefully this dependency will be
removed in the future.</p>

<p>Additional build tools are required to be present on the build system;
configure (see below) will install them if you are building on an
IPS-capable system, which is not supported nor recommended.  If you are
building in a SmartOS zone, which is the supported and recommended practice,
see <a href="http://wiki.smartos.org/display/DOC/Building+SmartOS+on+SmartOS">http://wiki.smartos.org/display/DOC/Building+SmartOS+on+SmartOS</a> for zone
setup instructions.  The existence and necessity of the "fake-subset" is a
bug that should be addressed by incorporating build-time tools into the
build process itself in the manner of usr/src/tools in illumos.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-build-steps" class="anchor" href="#build-steps" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Build Steps</h2>

<p>The configure script sets everything up for building including:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>ensures system has required packages installed (and is running on illumos!)</li>
<li>ensures SUNWspro is installed in <code>/opt/SUNWspro</code>
</li>
<li>downloads and installs gcc 4.4.4 in <code>/opt/gcc/4.4.4</code>
</li>
<li>ensures that <code>projects/illumos</code> exists and creates <code>illumos.sh</code> there</li>
<li>ensures that <code>projects/illumos-extra</code> exists</li>
<li>downloads the opensolaris manpages</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="user-content-the-make-world-works-as-follows" class="anchor" href="#the-make-world-works-as-follows" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The "make world" works as follows:</h3>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><p>The subset of illumos-extra required at build time to encode runtime
dependencies into illumos is built, starting with gcc 4.4.4, and
installed into the bootstrap proto area (by default, proto.strap).</p></li>
<li><p>The illumos source in projects/illumos (can be a link) is built with the
aid of tools/build_illumos and installed into the proto area.  The
compiler used is the one installed in <code>/opt/gcc/4.4.4</code>; this is a bug
covered by OS-1324.</p></li>
<li><p>All illumos-extra components are built and installed into the proto
area.</p></li>
<li><p>The local sources in the <code>src</code> subdirectory are built and installed into
the proto area.</p></li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="user-content-the-make-live-uses-the-toolsbuild_live-script-as-follows" class="anchor" href="#the-make-live-uses-the-toolsbuild_live-script-as-follows" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The "make live" uses the tools/build_live script as follows:</h3>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>
<p>The manifest is used, directories and links are created and files are taken:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>from an overlay directory, in the order specified by the configure
fragment's <code>OVERLAY</code> variable; then</li>
<li>from the proto area; finally</li>
<li>from the <code>man/man</code> subdirectory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Once the files are copied in, the tools/customize script is run which also
sources tools/customize.* if they exist</p></li>
<li><p>Then the image is packed up and put in output with an expanded directory and
a <code>platform-BUILDSTAMP.tgz</code></p></li>
<li>
<p>A log of the live image creation is written into the <code>log</code> subdirectory
containing entries of the form:</p>

<p>FILE: [path/to/file][PERM][owner/uid][group/gid]: OK (/path/to/source)
LINK(symlink): source =&gt; target: OK
LINK: source =&gt; target: OK
DIR: [path/to/dir][PERM][owner/uid][group/gid]: OK</p>

<p>If the build fails during this step, check the log file for any entries
containing FAIL.  In most cases, this will be the result of a bug in the
build system (or an object that was not delivered to the proto area, in
which case the failure to stop that build at that point is also a build
system bug).</p>
</li>

<a name="user-content-known-issues" class="anchor" href="#known-issues" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Known Issues</h2>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><p>There are still a small number of illumos-extra components that do not
use the unified makefile system, and are built against the build system's
headers and libraries. (TBD)</p></li>
<li><p>python should be part of illumos-extra, as there are a small number of
tools delivered that use it. (TBD)</p></li>
<li><p>The illumos-extra gcc 4.4.4 should be used to build illumos. (OS-1324)  </p></li>
<li><p>While there should never be a delivered object with build environment
DT_RPATH leakage, there is currently no tool for checking this.
(OS-1122)</p></li>
<li><p>There is also no tool for verifying that all objects delivered within
the platform have no dependencies outside the platform.  This includes
both runtime library linking and the execution of interpreters.
(OS-1122)</p></li>
<li><p>The fake-subset tarball, and likely the adjuncts tarball as well,
contains files that are no longer needed.  These should be pruned
aggressively so that we can use them as an inventory of remaining bugs
to be fixed. (OS-1326)</p></li>
<li><p>illumos-extra recurses over all components even during an incremental
build.  This is time-consuming and usually pointless. (OS-1319) </p></li>
<li><p>The complete set of build-order dependencies within illumos-extra
probably has not been enumerated.  Doing so would allow for greater
parallelism in that portion of the build.  In addition, it is likely
that many of the components are actually unsafe to build in parallel
internally. (TBD)</p></li>
<li><p>The illumos-extra unified makefile system is not documented.</p></li>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>The resulting image requires a 64-bit machine</li>
<li>The BUILDSTAMP is available in the live image in /etc/joyent_buildstamp</li>
<li>
<p>There is a manifest created:</p>

<p>output/platform-BUILDSTAMP/i86pc/amd64/boot_archive.manifest</p>

<p>which contains a list of all files/links in the image + md5sums of files and
is also available in the live image itself in /var/log/manifest</p>
