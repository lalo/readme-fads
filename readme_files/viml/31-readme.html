<p>Supertab is a vim plugin which allows you to use &lt;Tab&gt; for all your insert
completion needs (:help ins-completion).</p>
<h2>
<a name="user-content-features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Configurable to suit you needs:<ul>
<li>Default completion type to use.</li>
<li>Prevent &lt;Tab&gt; from completing after/before defined patterns.</li>
<li>Close vim's completion preview window when code completion is finished.</li>
<li>When using other completion types, you can configure how long to 'remember'
the current completion type before returning to the default.</li>
<li>Don't like using &lt;Tab&gt;? You can also configure a different pair of keys to
scroll forwards and backwards through completion results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Optional improved 'longest' completion support (after typing some characters,
hitting &lt;Tab&gt; will highlight the next longest match).</li>
<li>Built in 'context' completion option which chooses the appropriate completion
type based on the text preceding the cursor.<ul>
<li>You can also plug in your own functions to determine which completion type
to use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support for simple completion chaining (falling back to a different
completion type, keyword completion for example, if omni or user completion
returns no results).</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="user-content-installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>
<p>You have a few options when it comes to installing supertab:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use your linux package manager:</p>
<p>Some linux distributions include a supertab package so you don't have to
manage the install/upgrade of supertab separately from other software on your
system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a vim plugin manager:</p>
<p>There are several plugin managers for vim, which will either allow you to
manually clone vim plugin repositories, or will do so for you. Probably the
two most popular ones currently are <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">pathogen</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim">vundle</a>. Please refer to their docs for
instructions on how to install plugins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And lastly you can use the vimball (.vmb) file found on
<a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1643">vim.org</a>:</p>
<p>Vimball files are installed by simply opening them in vim and then sourcing
the file:</p>
<pre>
$ vim supertab.vmb
:source %
</pre>
</li>

<a name="user-content-frequently-asked-questions" class="anchor" href="#frequently-asked-questions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Why isn't supertab honoring my configured settings (attempts to complete at the
start of a line, always performs keyword completion instead of my configured
default, etc.)?</strong></p>
<p>Chances are that you have a very old version of <a href="https://github.com/msanders/snipmate.vim">snipmate</a> installed, or something similar,
which will issue a &lt;c-n&gt; when no snippet is found. Supertab use to map to
&lt;c-n&gt;, so this behavior would act as a fallback to supertab, but current
versions of supertab no longer do so, resulting in snipmate bypassing supertab
entirely.</p>
<p>You can check if this is the case by running the following in vim to see what
is mapped to &lt;tab&gt;:</p>
<pre>
:verbose imap &lt;tab&gt;
</pre>
<p>To resolve the issue you can either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install my <a href="https://github.com/ervandew/snipmate.vim">fork</a> or</li>
<li>Upgrade to a more recent snipmate fork, like <a href="https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate">garbas/vim-snipmate</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/ervandew/supertab/issues/74">#74</a> for additional
details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why does &lt;tab&gt; navigate the completion menu from bottom to top?</strong></p>
<p>First, if after reading the explanation below (or if you don't want to bother
reading it), you still want the default to scroll down the list then you can
use:</p>
<pre>
let g:SuperTabDefaultCompletionType = "&lt;c-n&gt;"
</pre>
<p>or if your default completion type is currently context then you can use
this instead:</p>
<pre>
let g:SuperTabContextDefaultCompletionType = "&lt;c-n&gt;"
</pre>
<p>Now on to the reasoning behind this. When using &lt;c-p&gt; or &lt;c-n&gt; to start
insert completion, both populate the completion popup with the same list of
words in the same order, the only difference is that &lt;c-p&gt; highlights the
nearest matching word located above the current cursor position, which is the
result at the bottom of the completion popup. Without supertab installed,
continuing to hit &lt;c-p&gt; will walk up the list to next nearest word above the
cursor.</p>
<p>I think Bram chose to display the results like this so that</p>
<ol>
<li>the completion logic is the same for &lt;c-n&gt; and &lt;c-p&gt;, only the first
entry to highlight differs</li>
<li>so that the behavior of &lt;c-p&gt; mode is consistent, always moving up the
list and</li>
<li>when starting &lt;c-p&gt; mode you don't have to switch over to
using &lt;c-n&gt; to get the next nearest entry, just continue to hit &lt;c-p&gt;.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, with supertab I wanted to preserve the same behavior. If &lt;c-p&gt; is your
default completion method (supertab defaults to this being the case), then
&lt;tab&gt; will start it and additional uses of &lt;tab&gt; will move up the list
instead of down so that you don't have to suddenly switch to using &lt;s-tab&gt;
to get the next nearest result.</p>
<p>Why is &lt;c-p&gt; the supertab default? The original supertab author found (and I
agree with his finding) that while coding, the keyword match you want is
typically the closer of the matches above the cursor, which &lt;c-p&gt; naturally
provides.</p>
