should make your time in insert mode a little bit easier, like syntax awareness (will not insert the closing delimiter
in comments and other configurable regions),  and  expansions (off by default), and some more.</p>

<p>Most of the features can be modified or disabled permanently, using global variables, or on a FileType basis, using
:autocmd.</p></article></div>
