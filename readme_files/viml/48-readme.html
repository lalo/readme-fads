<a name="user-content-sensiblevim" class="anchor" href="#sensiblevim" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>sensible.vim</h1>

<p>Think of sensible.vim as one step above <code>'nocompatible'</code> mode: a universal
set of defaults that (hopefully) everyone can agree on.</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>If you're new to Vim, you can install this as a starting point, rather than
copying some random vimrc you found.</li>
<li>If you're pair programming and you can't agree on whose vimrc to use, this
can be your neutral territory.</li>
<li>If you're administrating a server with an account that's not exclusively
yours, you can <code>scp</code> this up to make things a bit more tolerable.</li>
<li>If you're troubleshooting a plugin and need to rule out interference from
your vimrc, having this installed will ensure you still have some basic
amenities.</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="user-content-installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">pathogen.vim</a>, and
then simply copy and paste:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible.git
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible/tree/master/plugin/sensible.vim">source</a> for the authoritative list of features.  (Don't worry, it's
mostly <code>:set</code> calls.)  Here's a taste:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>
<code>'backspace'</code>: Backspace through anything in insert mode.</li>
<li>
<code>'incsearch'</code>: Start searching before pressing enter.</li>
<li>
<code>'listchars'</code>: Makes <code>:set list</code> (visible whitespace) prettier.</li>
<li>
<code>'scrolloff'</code>: Always show at least one line above/below the cursor.</li>
<li>
<code>runtime! macros/matchit.vim</code>: Load the version of matchit.vim that ships
with Vim.</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="user-content-faq" class="anchor" href="#faq" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FAQ</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>How can I see what this plugin actually does?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible/tree/master/plugin/sensible.vim">source</a> is authoritative.  Use <code>:help 'option'</code> to see the
documentation for an option.  If you install <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-scriptease">scriptease.vim</a>, you can press
<code>K</code> on an option (or command, or function) to jump to its documentation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How can I override a setting?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Normally, sensible.vim loads after your vimrc, making it a bit tricky to
override (although you could use <code>after/plugin/sensible.vim</code>).  If you want to
load it earlier, add the following line to you vimrc, then put your overrides
below.</p>

<pre><code>runtime! plugin/sensible.vim
</code></pre>

<p>Feel free to <a href="http://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible/issues">let me know</a> which setting you object to, so I
can reassess whether it makes sense to include it.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-contributing" class="anchor" href="#contributing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contributing</h2>

<p>I want this to be a plugin nobody objects to installing.  <a href="http://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible/issues">Let me
know</a> if you have any objections to <em>anything</em>.  There are a
handful of settings I figured <em>might</em> be controversial, but I included
anyways, just to settle the question once and for all.  It won't take much
persuasion for me to remove them.  Everything else is negotiable.</p>

<p>Feel free to ask a question if you're not sure why I've set something, as I
haven't put much effort into documenting that.</p>

<p>I'm a stickler for <a href="http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">commit messages</a>, so if you send me a pull request with
so much as a superfluous period in the subject line, I will close it without
so much as a second thought, and save my precious attention for someone who
can actually follow directions.</p>
