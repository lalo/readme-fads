<p>This is the development version of Vim's included syntax highlighting and
filetype plugins for Markdown.  Generally you don't need to install these if
you are running a recent version of Vim.</p>

<p>One difference between this repository and the upstream files in Vim is that
the former forces <code>*.md</code> as Markdown, while the latter detects it as Modula-2,
with an exception for <code>README.md</code>.  If you'd like to force Markdown without
installing from this repository, add the following to your vimrc:</p>

<pre><code>autocmd BufNewFile,BufReadPost *.md set filetype=markdown
</code></pre>
