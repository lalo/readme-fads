<p>crouton is a set of scripts that bundle up into an easy-to-use,
Chromium OS-centric chroot generator. Currently Ubuntu and Debian are
supported (using debootstrap behind the scenes), but "Chromium OS Debian,
Ubuntu, and Probably Other Distros Eventually Chroot Environment" doesn't
acronymize as well (crodupodece is admittedly pretty fun to say, though).</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-croutonan-acronym" class="anchor" href="#croutonan-acronym" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>"crouton"...an acronym?</h2>

<p>It stands for <em>ChRomium Os Universal chrooT envirONment</em>
...or something like that. Do capitals really matter if caps-lock has been
(mostly) banished, and the keycaps are all lower-case?</p>

<p>Moving on...</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-whos-this-for" class="anchor" href="#whos-this-for" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who's this for?</h2>

<p>Anyone who wants to run straight Linux on their Chromium OS device, and doesn't
care about physical security. You're also better off having some knowledge of
Linux tools and the command line in case things go funny, but it's not strictly
necessary.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-whats-a-chroot" class="anchor" href="#whats-a-chroot" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's a chroot?</h2>

<p>Like virtualization, chroots provide the guest OS with their own, segregated
file system to run in, allowing applications to run in a different binary
environment from the host OS. Unlike virtualization, you are <em>not</em> booting a
second OS; instead, the guest OS is running using the Chromium OS system. The
benefit to this is that there is zero speed penalty since everything is run
natively, and you aren't wasting RAM to boot two OSes at the same time. The
downside is that you must be running the correct chroot for your hardware, the
software must be compatible with Chromium OS's kernel, and machine resources are
inextricably tied between the host Chromium OS and the guest OS. What this means
is that while the chroot cannot directly access files outside of its view, it
<em>can</em> access all of your hardware devices, including the entire contents of
memory. A root exploit in your guest OS will essentially have unfettered access
to the rest of Chromium OS.</p>

<p>...but hey, you can run TuxRacer!</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-prerequisites" class="anchor" href="#prerequisites" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>You need a device running Chromium OS that has been switched to developer mode.
Note that developer mode, in its default configuration, is <em>completely
insecure</em>, so don't expect a password in your chroot to keep anyone from your
data. crouton does support encrypting chroots, but the encryption is only as
strong as the quality of your passphrase. Consider this your warning.</p>

<p>That's it! Surprised?</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>crouton is a powerful tool, and there are a <em>lot</em> of features, but basic usage
is as simple as possible by design.</p>

<p>If you're just here to use crouton, you can grab the latest release from
<a href="http://goo.gl/fd3zc">goo.gl/fd3zc</a>. Download it, pop open a shell
(Ctrl+Alt+T, type <code>shell</code> and hit enter), and run <code>sh ~/Downloads/crouton</code> to
see the help text. See the "examples" section for some usage examples.</p>

<p>If you're modifying crouton, you'll probably want to clone or download the repo
and then either run <code>installer/main.sh</code> directly, or use <code>make</code> to build your
very own <code>crouton</code>. You can also download the latest release, cd into the
Downloads folder, and run <code>sh crouton -x</code> to extract out the juicy scripts
contained within, but you'll be missing build-time stuff like the Makefile.</p>

<p>crouton uses the concept of "targets" to decide what to install. While you will
have apt-get in your chroot, some targets may need minor hacks to avoid issues
when running in the chrooted environment. As such, if you expect to want
something that is fulfilled by a target, install that target when you make the
chroot and you'll have an easier time.  Don't worry if you forget to include a
target; you can always update the chroot later and add it. You can see the list
of available targets by running <code>sh ~/Downloads/crouton -t help</code>.</p>

<p>Once you've set up your chroot, you can easily enter it using the
newly-installed <code>enter-chroot</code> command, or one of the target-specific
start* commands. Ta-da! That was easy.</p>

<li>You can get some extra protection on your chroot by storing the decryption
 key separately from the place the chroot is stored. Use the <code>-k</code> parameter
 to specify a file or directory to store the keys in (such as a USB drive or
 SD card) when you create the chroot. Beware that if you lose this file,
 your chroot will not be decryptable. That's kind of the point, of course.</li>

<li>You can change the distro mirror from the default by using <code>-m</code>

<li>A script is installed in your chroot called <code>brightness</code>. You can assign
this to keyboard shortcuts to adjust the brightness of the screen (e.g.
<code>brightness up</code>) or keyboard (e.g. <code>brightness k down</code>).</li>
<li>Multiple monitors will work fine in the chroot, but you may have to switch
to Chromium OS and back to enable them.</li>
<li>You can make commands run in the background so that you can close the
terminal. This is particularly useful for desktop environments: try running
<code>sudo startxfce4 -b</code>
</li>
<li>Want to disable Chromium OS's power management? Run <code>croutonpowerd -i</code>
</li>
<li>Only want power management disabled for the duration of a command?
<code>croutonpowerd -i command and arguments</code> will automatically stop inhibiting
power management when the command exits.</li>
<li>Have a Pixel or two or 4.352 million? <code>-t touch</code> improves touch support.</li>

<a name="user-content-issues" class="anchor" href="#issues" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Issues?</h2>

<p>Running another OS in a chroot is a pretty messy technique (although it's hidden
behind very pretty scripts), and these scripts are relatively new, so problems
are not surprising. Check the issue tracker and file a bug if your issue isn't
there. When filing a new bug, include the output of <code>croutonversion</code> run from
inside the chroot (if possible).</p>

<p>That's great!  But before your code can be merged, you'll need to have signed
the <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual#sign-electronically">Individual Contributor License Agreement</a>.
Don't worry, it only takes a minute and you'll definitely get to keep your
firstborn, probably.  If you've already signed it for contributing to Chromium
or Chromium OS, you're already done.</p>

<p>If you don't know what to do with your time as an official Contributor, here's
some suggestions:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Really like a certain desktop environment? Fork crouton, add the target, and
create a pull request.</li>
<li>Feel like hacking around with Chromium OS integration? Fork crouton, improve
integration, and create a pull request.</li>
<li>Is your distro underrepresented? Want to contribute to the elusive and
mythical beast known as "croagh"? Fork crouton, add the distro, and create a
pull request.</li>
<li>Discovered a bug lurking within the scripts, or a papercut that bothers you
just enough to make you want to actually do something about it? You guessed
it: fork crouton, fix everything, and create a pull request.</li>
