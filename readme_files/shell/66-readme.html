<p>A lightweight service that provides automated file synchronization between
multiple hosts.</p>

<p>lipsync is an open source, lightweight service that provides automated
two-way, <a href="http://bit.ly/1IGiJu">Dropbox</a> file synchronization in
Linux by utilizing <a href="http://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a>, <a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a>, and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/lsyncd/">lsyncd</a>. lipsync is a
realization of a popular blog post of mine named <a href="http://fak3r.com/2009/09/14/howto-build-your-own-open-source-dropbox-clone/">HOWTO
build your own open source Dropbox clone</a>. Since I made the posting
I've received a great deal of interest, and had time to test and
architect a workable solution. Thanks to everyone that read, commented and
encouraged the further development of this idea!</p>

<p>The basic idea and example of a working system can be seen <a href="https://github.com/philcryer/lipsync/raw/master/docs/diagram.png">here</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>automatic file synchronization from multiple clients to a central server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>two way syncing with changes tracked and propagated to the clients by the
server (Dropbox style)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>transfers secured and tunneled through OpenSSH</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>safe for everyday use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>low fat</p>
</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="user-content-dependencies" class="anchor" href="#dependencies" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dependencies</h2>

<p>To get started with lipsync you need at least a client and a server,
preferably on multiple systems. Software requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Server - Linux 2.6.x, rsync (client), opensshd (server)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client - Linux 2.6.x, rsync (client), openssh (client), lsyncd</p>
</li>
</ul><h2>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting started</h2>

<pre>git clone git@github.com:philcryer/lipsync.git
cd lipsync
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh</pre>

<p>After that, see the docs/INSTALL file or online, <a href="https://github.com/philcryer/lipsync/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.rdoc#readme">INSTALL</a>
for full documentation.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-caveats" class="anchor" href="#caveats" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Caveats</h2>

<p>Much of the initial feedback I received asked for a graphical user
interface and support for Windows. Please know that I have attempted
neither, instead deciding to focus on the basic server-side functionality.
This allowed me to flesh out the architecture, deciding on all the options
and understanding ways to improve the transfer performance. Since most of
the software used for lipsync is cross-platform, I'd be interested in
working with others that want to build a gui front end to talk to the the
lipsync backend service. I've been interested in the work done on the
<a href="http://sparkleshare.org/">SparkleShare</a> project, and since it
can use different backends I'm hopeful that it will be agnostic enough
to adapt to use lipsync.</p>
