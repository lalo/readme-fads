<p>A programming font, designed with functionality in mind, and with some 
wibbly-wobbly handwriting-like fuzziness that makes it unassumingly cool.

<p>Previously known as <em>Cosmic Sans Neue Mono</em>. It
appeared that <a href="https://github.com/belluzj/cosmic-sans-neue/issues/16">similar names were already in use for other
fonts</a>, and that
people tended to extend their instinctive hatred of Comic Sans to this very
font of mine (which of course can only be <em>loved</em>). Why the previous name?
Here is my original explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The name comes from my realization that at some point it looked like the
mutant child of Comic Sans and Helvetica Neue. Hopefully it is not the
case any more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Inspirational sources include Inconsolata and Monaco. I have also been using 
Consolas a lot in my programming life, so it may have some points in common.</p>

<p>The font includes a bold version, with the same metrics as the regular one. 
Both versions include the same ranges of characters : latin letters, some
accented glyphs (quite a lot), some greek letters, some arrows.</p>

<p>Please note that I have not tested all of the glyphs I have drawn (some letters
have those two layers of crazy accents that I have never witnessed before), so
it might look bad in some cases. Please report these problems: see next section.</p>

<p>It also features a good italic version, which I designed in a fashion similar
to Consolas' italic version, with new glyph designs, not just an added slant.</p>

<p>Run <code>make</code>. You should see green stuff and some "OK" messages.
The build process requires FontForge with python scripting support,
<code>ttfautohint</code>, <code>sfnt2woff</code> (from the <code>woff-tools</code> package on Ubuntu) and
<code>ttf2eot</code>, for example from <a href="https://github.com/harrastia/ttf2eot">this
repository</a>.</p>

<p><code>make install</code> will install the TTF fonts into your local <code>.fonts/</code> directory 
and update the font cache. It comes in handy while modifying the font.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-versions" class="anchor" href="#versions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Versions</h2>

<p>1.1 - First release.</p>

<p>1.1.1 - Make slashes longer, ensure parenthesis and brackets are rendered at 
        the same height, and some other minor adjustments.</p>

<p>1.2 - Add the bold version.
      Various minor adjustments, new paragraph symbol, slanted dollar.</p>

<p>1.2.1 - Minor adjustments.</p>

<p>1.3 - Very slight change of metrics to add space between characters and lines.
      Various small changes : curlier curly brackets, more difference between
      various quotes, cleaner W, w, m, and rounder @. 
      Windows compatibility.
      More latin accents.
      Greek letters.
      Powerline characters.</p>

<p>1.3.1 - Various fixes: still cleaning m and w, reworked all ogoneks, changed a
        bit the dollar, moved some accents, eliminated glitches around
        Powerline symbols.
        TTF fonts are now hinted using Freetype's <code>ttfautohint</code>, which should
        give much better results on Windows (and maybe in Java apps and others
        contexts). In case this is a problem, please let me know and I will
        provide also an unhinted version.
        <strong>Windows users should use the TTF (TrueType) files.</strong></p>

<p>1.3.2 - Various fixes: playing again with bold m, moving accents again, taking
        care again of Powerline symbols, clean 8 and R.
        Add a few box drawing characters (for use with vim-indentline).
        Generate webfonts (goal: this font used for code samples on all cool
        languages' websites).
        Add a WIP medium version of the proportional font.</p>

<p>1.4 - Rename font to <strong>Fantasque Sans</strong>, because <em>fantasque is the new cosmic</em>.
      Make W look symetrical at big size.</p>

<p>1.4.1 - Drop Reserved Font Name. <strong>You can now subset, compress, hint and
        whatnot without worrying about renaming</strong>.
        Many small improvements (8, s , t, a, e, {, }, W, i, l, g...).</p>

<p>1.5 - Add regular italic version.
      Some small changes (Q, w, y, n).</p>

<p>1.6.1 - Simplify @ to make it look sharp at all sizes.
        Various fixes.</p>

<p>1.6.2 - Make <code>+</code> symmetrical, align dots in <code>:</code> and <code>;</code>.</p>

<p>1.6.3 - Add block characters.
        Make the underscore visible on Windows.
        Generate better CSS.</p>
