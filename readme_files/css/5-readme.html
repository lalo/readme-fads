<p>This repository is meant to provide an example for <em>forking</em> a repository on GitHub.</p>

<p>Creating a <em>fork</em> is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit <em>Pull Requests</em> to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.</p>

<p>After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit <a href="https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls">a Pull Request</a> as practice.</p>

<p>For some more information on how to fork a repository, <a href="http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/">check out our guide, "Forking Projects""</a>.
