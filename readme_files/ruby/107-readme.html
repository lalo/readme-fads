<div class="announce instapaper_body " data-path="README" id="readme"><div class="plain"><pre>1. What is Rubinius

Rubinius is an implementation of the Ruby programming language. Rubinius aims
to be compatible with Ruby version 2.1.

Rubinius includes a Ruby parser, bytecode virtual machine, bytecode compiler,
generational garbage collector, and just-in-time (JIT) native machine code
compiler. Rubinius uses native OS threads with no global interpreter lock.
Rubinius also provides C-API compatibility for native C extensions.

The Ruby core library is written almost entirely in Ruby. Rubinius tools, such
as the bytecode compiler and debugger, are also written in Ruby.  Rubinius
provides the same standard libraries as Matz's Ruby implementation (MRI) with
the following exceptions:

* Continuation
* Ripper
* TracePoint
* Tracer

Rubinius runs on Mac OS X and many Unix/Linux operating systems.  Microsoft
Windows is not yet supported.

Most popular Ruby applications, like Rails, run on Rubinius.
