<p>Dropplets is a minimalist <strong>Markdown</strong> blogging platform focused on delivering just what you need in a blogging solution, but absolutely nothing you don't. When it comes to basic blogging, all you really want to do is write &amp; publish which is where Dropplets excels. It's databaseless, so it installs on any server in just about 30 seconds. </p>

<p>Markdown is a text formatting syntax inspired on plain text email. It is extremely simple, memorizable and visually lightweight on artifacts so as not to hinder reading.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.</p>

<p>Dropplets is compatible with most server configurations and can be typically installed in under a minute using the few step-by-step instructions below:</p>

<ol class="task-list">
<li>Download the latest <strong>release</strong> and then extract the downloaded zip file.</li>
<li>Upload the entire contents of the extracted zip file to your web server wherever you want Dropplets to be installed. </li>
<li>Pull up your site in any modern web browser (e.g. if you uploaded Dropplets to <strong>yoursite.com</strong>, load <strong>yoursite.com</strong> in your browser to finish the installation), then create and confirm your password.</li>
</ol><h2>
<a name="user-content-writing-posts" class="anchor" href="#writing-posts" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Writing Posts</h2>

<p>With Dropplets, you write your posts offline (using the text or Markdown editor of your choice) in Markdown format. Here's a handy <a href="https://github.com/circa75/dropplets/wiki/Markdown-Syntax-Guide">syntax guide</a> if you need a little help with your Markdown skills. All posts for Dropplets <strong>MUST</strong> be composed using the following format:</p>

<pre><code># Your Post Title
- Post Author Name (e.g. "Dropplets")
- Post Author Twitter Handle (e.g. "dropplets")
- Publish Date in YYYY/MM/DD Format (e.g. "2013/04/28")
- Post Category (e.g. "Random Thoughts")
- Post Status (e.g. "published" or "draft")

Your post text starts here. 
</code></pre>

<p>All posts must also be saved with the <strong>.md</strong> file extension. For instance, if your post title is <strong>My First Blog Post</strong>, your post file should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>my-first-blog-post.md
</code></pre>

<p>Some templates include the ability to add a post image or thumbnail along with your post in which should match your post file name like this:</p>

<pre><code>my-first-blog-post.jpg
</code></pre>

<p>Post file names are used to structure post permalinks on your blog. So, a post file saved as <strong>my-first-blog-post.md</strong> will result in <strong>yoursite.com/my-first-blog-post</strong> as the post permalink.</p>

<p>After you've finished writing your post offline, you can then publish your post using the Dropplets toolbar:</p>

<ol class="task-list">
<li>Login to your Dropplets installation using the password you created during the installation and setup process.</li>
<li>Click the Dropplet in your toolbar to select, upload and publish your post.</li>

<p>Re-upload your edited post file using the steps above. Doing this will automatically overwrite the existing post and publish your new edits. To delete a post, change the <strong>Post Status</strong> at the top of your post file to <strong>draft</strong>.</p>
