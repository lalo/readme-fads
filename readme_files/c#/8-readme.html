<p>v2.1.x is still BETA.  For iOS, Android, Windows, and Windows phone it should be quite stable still, however this is a first release of Blackberry and Amazon support!</p>

<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Amazon Device Messaging support</li>
<li>Chrome GCM support</li>
<li>Blackberry BIS (and BES in theory) support</li>
<li>Performance enhancements</li>
<li>APNS Stability Improvements</li>

<a name="user-content-v20-release-notes" class="anchor" href="#v20-release-notes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>v2.0 Release Notes</h2>

<p>PushSharp v2.0 has finally arrived.  It is the culmination of hours of refactoring, decoupling, simplifying, and testing.  The main emphasis on this release was to refactor the code to decouple various classes so that Unit Tests could finally be written.  </p>

<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>PushService was renamed to PushBroker</li>
<li>PushSharp.Common is now PushSharp.Core</li>
<li>PushSharp assembly was merged with PushSharp.Core</li>
<li>PushSharp.Core no longer depends on each specific platform, but each specific platform depends on PushSharp.Core</li>
<li>Unit Tests are now available using NUnit and Moq</li>
<li>Push 'Channels' are now less sophisticated and not responsible for handling their own queues, which should result in fewer possible points of failure</li>
<li>Each specific platform assembly is now dependant on PushSharp.Core</li>
<li>Scaling logic was greatly improved</li>
<li>Apple (APNS) more stable and resilient to connection failures</li>
<li>Various other bugfixes</li>
</ul><p><strong>PushBroker - Registering Services</strong></p>

<p>Since PushSharp.Core no longer references individual platform assemblies, it was not practical to keep the same pattern of pushSharpInstance.StartApplePushService(...).  Instead, PushBroker contains a .RegisterService(TPushService svc) method.  </p>

<p>In addition, each platform also includes extension methods to assist in registering the platform specific services.  If you are using the PushSharp namespace, for example, you could call pushBrokerInstance.RegisterAppleService(...) which works very similarly to how the old PushService methods worked!</p>

<p>See the sample for more info!</p>

<p><strong>Thanks!</strong>
Special thanks goes out to the MvvmCross room on Jabbr, and especially Greg Shackles for his helpful suggestions and feedback during the refactoring process!</p>

<h5>
<a name="user-content-how-do-i-use-pushsharp-in-my-aspnet-web-application" class="anchor" href="#how-do-i-use-pushsharp-in-my-aspnet-web-application" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How do I use PushSharp in my ASP.NET Web Application?</h5>

<p>An ASP.NET application is NOT the ideal place to use PushSharp.  You'd be better off using a Windows Service, or some other infrastructure if at all possible.  The reason is that in an ASP.NET application, the Application Pool (AppPool) can be restarted on you and is usually not under your direct control, which means all the Queued notifications that PushSharp may be in the process of sending could be lost if PushSharp is not cleaned up gracefully.</p>

<p>If you MUST run PushSharp in an ASP.NET application, the best way is to create a <strong><em>singleton PushBroker instance</em></strong> in your Global.asax file.  You should keep this singleton instance around for the lifespan of your web application, including a call to pushBroker.StopAllServices() when your Application is ending (Application_End in global.asax).</p>

<p>You can help mitigate losing messages due to unforeseen App Pool terminations or restarts by persisting notifications you want to send in some other way, and only removing them from that persistent storage once the OnNotificationSent event has fired.  This is still not perfect (you may risk multiple notification deliveries), but it's probably adequate for most.</p>

<p>You should not be creating and destroying instances of PushBroker each time you send a notification, as this uses unnecessary resources and if you're using Apple APNS, they require you to keep the connection to their servers open as long as possible when sending notifications.  You should also call pushBroker.StopAllServices() in your Application_Ended event in your Global.asax.  Keep in mind that PushSharp works.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> as of version 2.1.2 PushSharp now supports the concept of an arbitrary ApplicationId when you Start or Register push services, for example:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-csharp"><pre><span class="c1">//Specify your application id when registering the service</span>
<span class="n">pushBroker</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">RegisterAppleService</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">channelSettings</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"MY-APP-ID-HERE"</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="c1">//Specify the application id for which the notification is intended when queueing</span>
<span class="n">pushBroker</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">QueueNotification</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">notification</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"MY-APP-ID"</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The alternative (old) way is to create an instance of PushBroker for each application you need.  </p>

<p>Given that PushSharp is written in C#, you probably thought there was a good chance that it's being used somewhere with MonoTouch or Mono for Android... and you would be correct!  There are samples of how to setup the client app push notification end of things included in the PushSharp project source!  There's even a Windows Phone 7.5 project to show how to register for notifications!</p>

<p>All client samples can be found in the <strong>/Client.Samples/</strong> folder.  </p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-pushsharpclientsamplemonoforandroid" class="anchor" href="#pushsharpclientsamplemonoforandroid" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PushSharp.ClientSample.MonoForAndroid</h2>

<p>There are two projects for Mono For Android:</p>

<ol class="task-list">
<li>PushSharp.ClientSample.C2dm</li>
<li>PushSharp.ClientSample.Gcm</li>
</ol><p>C2DM is now deprecated by Google, and you can ignore it unless you are working with an application that already uses it.  Otherwise, focus on the <em>GCM</em> project.  </p>

<p>The GCM project also references the <strong><em>/PushSharp.Client/PushSharp.Client.MonoForAndroid.Gcm</em></strong> project which is a client library (ported from the java gcm-client library).  It is a helper library for managing GCM registrations on the client side, within your Android app.  You don't necessarily need to understand the code in this library, but just know that this Client Sample project references it for its own use!  </p>

<p><strong>VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> Make sure your package name does not start with an uppercase character.  If it does, you will get cryptic errors in logcat and things will not work, because your package name is used in defining some permissions required by GCM. 
Eg: my.package.name is ok, but My.package.name is NOT</p>

<p>Next, take a look at the PushService.cs file in the sample project.  You can copy much of this class into your own App, but again be sure to substitute your own package name in where applicable (the BroadcastReceiver attributes need to be changed).  You will also need to change the SENDER_ID constant to your own (see the documentation for Configuring GCM with PushSharp in the wiki).  Finally, in this class, you will probably want to change what happens in some of the GCMIntentService methods.  In the OnRegistered, you would want to send the registration ID to your server, so that you can use it to send the device notifications.  You get the point.</p>

<p>Registering for remote notifications in MonoTouch is fairly trivial.  The only real tricky part is figuring out how to get the deviceToken into a nice string that you can send to your server.  Check out <em>AppDelegate.cs</em> for details on how this is done in MonoTouch!</p>
