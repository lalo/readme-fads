<p>This module contains MonoMac and MonoTouch API bindings for popular 
iOS or MacOS libraries that developers can reuse on their own 
applications.</p>

<p>If you would like to get your binding added, contact us.</p>

<p>To build MonoTouch bindings:</p>

<pre><code>To build, run `make' on the toplevel directory to build all
iOS, or if you only want to build a specific module run `make'
on the specific directory.
</code></pre>

<p>To build OSX bindings:</p>

<pre><code>Run `make osx' at the toplevel directory, or go into the
specific directory and run `make osx'
</code></pre>
