<p>Please check the project website for more samples and a screencast: <a href="http://vimeo.com/13138838">http://vimeo.com/13138838</a></p>

<p>If you have any questions or ideas, please use the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/norm-mongodb">Google Group</a> to convey them (Hint: this will also be a good way to be notified when we get close to a release)</p>

<p><em>The API may change a bit over time, and there remain a few more features before we will cut a "Release" but the library is pretty stable, and has good unit test coverage for the core components. If you have ideas or requests, let us know - or fork them and share with us.</em></p>

<p><em>NoRM provides:</em></p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Strongly-typed interaction when querying and updating collections.</li>
<li>Improved interface to send common MongoDB commands (creating indices, getting all the existing dbs and collections, etc.).</li>
<li>Ultra-fast de/serialization of BSON to .Net CLR types and back.</li>
<li>Fluent mappings to specify the property names and characteristics at runtime, rather than attributes.</li>
<li>An optional fluent configuration for mapping types and properties to different names and collections in the DB.</li>
<li>LINQ-to-Mongo</li>
<li>NoRM will work under both Mono &amp; .Net</li>
</ul><p>It would also be useful to read what we have on the <a href="http://wiki.github.com/atheken/NoRM/">wiki</a>.</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>The NoRM.dll can connect to MongoDB, this is the workhorse of NoRM, and all you really need to get started.</li>
<li>The NoRM.Tests.dll are nunit tests for NoRM, we are much more likely to accept patches that have corresponding tests.</li>
