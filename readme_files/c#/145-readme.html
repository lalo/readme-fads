<p>InControl is an input manager for Unity3D that standardizes input mappings across various platforms for common controllers.</p>

<p>Documentation is available at: <a href="http://www.gallantgames.com/incontrol">http://www.gallantgames.com/incontrol</a></p>

<p>InControl is also <a href="http://u3d.as/6mr">available on the Unity Asset Store</a> for a modest price. If you find this project beneficial, please consider supporting its ongoing development. You'll have the convenience of easy installation and updates right from the Unity Editor.</p>

<p>As development continues, a few additional "pro" features will be available on the Asset Store only, and will not be open sourced in the repository.</p>
