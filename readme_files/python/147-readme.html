<p>OpenStack Nova provides a cloud computing fabric controller,
supporting a wide variety of virtualization technologies,
including KVM, Xen, LXC, VMware, and more. In addition to
its native API, it includes compatibility with the commonly
encountered Amazon EC2 and S3 APIs.</p>
<p>OpenStack Nova is distributed under the terms of the Apache
License, Version 2.0. The full terms and conditions of this
license are detailed in the LICENSE file.</p>
<p>Nova primarily consists of a set of Python daemons, though
it requires and integrates with a number of native system
components for databases, messaging and virtualization
capabilities.</p>

<p>In the unfortunate event that bugs are discovered, they should
be reported to the appropriate bug tracker. If you obtained
the software from a 3rd party operating system vendor, it is
often wise to use their own bug tracker for reporting problems.
In all other cases use the master OpenStack bug tracker,
available at:</p>

<p>Any new code must follow the development guidelines detailed
in the HACKING.rst file, and pass all unit tests. Further
developer focused documentation is available at:</p>
