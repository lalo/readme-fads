<p>bup is a program that backs things up.  It's short for "backup." Can you
believe that nobody else has named an open source program "bup" after all
this time?  Me neither.</p>

<p>Despite its unassuming name, bup is pretty cool.  To give you an idea of
just how cool it is, I wrote you this poem:</p>

<pre><code>                         Bup is teh awesome
                      What rhymes with awesome?
                        I guess maybe possum
                       But that's irrelevant.
</code></pre>

<p>Hmm.  Did that help?  Maybe prose is more useful after all.</p>

<a name="user-content-reasons-bup-is-awesome" class="anchor" href="#reasons-bup-is-awesome" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reasons bup is awesome</h2>

<p>bup has a few advantages over other backup software:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><p>It uses a rolling checksum algorithm (similar to rsync) to split large
files into chunks.  The most useful result of this is you can backup huge
virtual machine (VM) disk images, databases, and XML files incrementally,
even though they're typically all in one huge file, and not use tons of
disk space for multiple versions.</p></li>
<li><p>It uses the packfile format from git (the open source version control
system), so you can access the stored data even if you don't like bup's
user interface.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike git, it writes packfiles <em>directly</em> (instead of having a separate
garbage collection / repacking stage) so it's fast even with gratuitously
huge amounts of data.  bup's improved index formats also allow you to
track far more filenames than git (millions) and keep track of far more
objects (hundreds or thousands of gigabytes).</p></li>
<li><p>Data is "automagically" shared between incremental backups without having
to know which backup is based on which other one - even if the backups
are made from two different computers that don't even know about each
other.  You just tell bup to back stuff up, and it saves only the minimum
amount of data needed.</p></li>
<li><p>You can back up directly to a remote bup server, without needing tons of
temporary disk space on the computer being backed up.  And if your backup
is interrupted halfway through, the next run will pick up where you left
off.  And it's easy to set up a bup server: just install bup on any
machine where you have ssh access.</p></li>
<li><p>Bup can use "par2" redundancy to recover corrupted backups even if your
disk has undetected bad sectors.</p></li>
<li><p>Even when a backup is incremental, you don't have to worry about
restoring the full backup, then each of the incrementals in turn; an
incremental backup <em>acts</em> as if it's a full backup, it just takes less
disk space.</p></li>
<li><p>You can mount your bup repository as a FUSE filesystem and access the
content that way, and even export it over Samba.</p></li>
<li><p>It's written in python (with some C parts to make it faster) so it's easy
for you to extend and maintain.</p></li>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><p>This is a very early version. Therefore it will most probably not work
for you, but we don't know why.  It is also missing some
probably-critical features.</p></li>
<li><p>It requires python &gt;= 2.5, a C compiler, and an installed git
version &gt;= 1.5.3.1.  It also requires par2 if you want fsck to be
able to generate the information needed to recover from some types
of corruption.</p></li>

NetBSD, Solaris, or Windows (with Cygwin).  Patches to support
other platforms are welcome.</p></li>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>
<p>Check out the bup source code using git:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/bup/bup
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install the required python libraries (including the development
libraries).</p>

<p>On very recent Debian/Ubuntu versions, this may be sufficient (run
as root):</p>

<pre><code>    apt-get build-dep bup
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise try this (substitute python2.5-dev or python2.6-dev if
you have an older system):</p>

<pre><code>    apt-get install python2.7-dev python-fuse
    apt-get install python-pyxattr python-pylibacl
    apt-get install linux-libc-dev
    apt-get install acl attr
    apt-get install python-tornado # optional
</code></pre>

<p>On CentOS (for CentOS 6, at least), this should be sufficient (run
as root):</p>

<pre><code>    yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
    yum install python python-devel
    yum install fuse-python pyxattr pylibacl
    yum install perl-Time-HiRes
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to the default CentOS repositories, you may need to add
RPMForge (for fuse-python) and EPEL (for pyxattr and pylibacl).</p>

<p>On Cygwin, install python, make, rsync, and gcc4.</p>

<p>If you would like to use the optional bup web server on systems
without a tornado package, you may want to try this:</p>

<pre><code>    pip install tornado
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build the python module and symlinks:</p>

<pre><code>make
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the tests:</p>

<pre><code>make test
</code></pre>

<p>(The tests should pass.  If they don't pass for you, stop here and send
 an email to <a href="mailto:bup-list@googlegroups.com">bup-list@googlegroups.com</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can install bup via "make install", and override the default
destination with DESTDIR and PREFIX.</p>

<p>Files are normally installed to "$DESTDIR/$PREFIX" where DESTDIR is
empty by default, and PREFIX is set to /usr.  So if you wanted to
install bup to /opt/bup, you might do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>make install DESTDIR=/opt/bup PREFIX=''

<h2>
<a name="user-content-basic-storage" class="anchor" href="#basic-storage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Basic storage:</h2>

<p>bup stores its data in a git-formatted repository.  Unfortunately, git
itself doesn't actually behave very well for bup's use case (huge numbers of
files, files with huge sizes, retaining file permissions/ownership are
important), so we mostly don't use git's <em>code</em> except for a few helper
programs.  For example, bup has its own git packfile writer written in
python.</p>

<p>Basically, 'bup split' reads the data on stdin (or from files specified on
the command line), breaks it into chunks using a rolling checksum (similar to
rsync), and saves those chunks into a new git packfile.  There is one git
packfile per backup.</p>

<p>When deciding whether to write a particular chunk into the new packfile, bup
first checks all the other packfiles that exist to see if they already have that
chunk.  If they do, the chunk is skipped.</p>

<p>git packs come in two parts: the pack itself (<em>.pack) and the index (</em>.idx).
The index is pretty small, and contains a list of all the objects in the
pack.  Thus, when generating a remote backup, we don't have to have a copy
of the packfiles from the remote server: the local end just downloads a copy
of the server's <em>index</em> files, and compares objects against those when
generating the new pack, which it sends directly to the server.</p>

<p>The "-n" option to 'bup split' and 'bup save' is the name of the backup you
want to create, but it's actually implemented as a git branch.  So you can
do cute things like checkout a particular branch using git, and receive a
bunch of chunk files corresponding to the file you split.</p>

<p>If you use '-b' or '-t' or '-c' instead of '-n', bup split will output a
list of blobs, a tree containing that list of blobs, or a commit containing
that tree, respectively, to stdout.  You can use this to construct your own
scripts that do something with those values.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-the-bup-index" class="anchor" href="#the-bup-index" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The bup index:</h2>

<p>'bup index' walks through your filesystem and updates a file (whose name is,
by default, ~/.bup/bupindex) to contain the name, attributes, and an
optional git SHA1 (blob id) of each file and directory.</p>

<p>'bup save' basically just runs the equivalent of 'bup split' a whole bunch
of times, once per file in the index, and assembles a git tree
that contains all the resulting objects.  Among other things, that makes
'git diff' much more useful (compared to splitting a tarball, which is
essentially a big binary blob).  However, since bup splits large files into
smaller chunks, the resulting tree structure doesn't <em>exactly</em> correspond to
what git itself would have stored.  Also, the tree format used by 'bup save'
will probably change in the future to support storing file ownership, more
complex file permissions, and so on.</p>

<p>If a file has previously been written by 'bup save', then its git blob/tree
id is stored in the index.  This lets 'bup save' avoid reading that file to
produce future incremental backups, which means it can go <em>very</em> fast unless
a lot of files have changed.</p>

<p>Help with any of these problems, or others, is very welcome.  Join the
mailing list (see below) if you'd like to help.</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>
<p>'bup restore' can't pull directly from a remote server.</p>

<p>So in one sense "save -r" is a dead-end right now.  Obviously you
can use "ssh SERVER bup restore -C ./dest..." to create a tree you
can transfer elsewhere via rsync/tar/whatever, but that's <em>lame</em>.</p>

<p>Until we fix it, you may be able to mount the remote BUP_DIR via
sshfs and then restore "normally", though that hasn't been
officially tested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'bup save' and 'bup restore' have immature metadata support.</p>

<p>On the plus side, they actually do have support now, but it's new,
and not remotely as well tested as tar/rsync/whatever's.  However,
you have to start somewhere, and as of 0.25, we think it's ready
for more general use.  Please let us know if you have any trouble.</p>

<p>Also, if any strip or graft-style options are specified to 'bup
save', then no metadata will be written for the root directory.
That's obviously less than ideal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bup is overly optimistic about mmap.  Right now bup just assumes
that it can mmap as large a block as it likes, and that mmap will
never fail.  Yeah, right... If nothing else, this has failed on
32-bit architectures (and 31-bit is even worse -- looking at you,
s390).</p>

<p>To fix this, we might just implement a FakeMmap[1] class that uses
normal file IO and handles all of the mmap methods[2] that bup
actually calls.  Then we'd swap in one of those whenever mmap
fails.</p>

<p>This would also require implementing some of the methods needed to
support "[]" array access, probably at a minimum <strong>getitem</strong>,
<strong>setitem</strong>, and <strong>setslice</strong> [3].</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>'bup index' is slower than it should be.</p>

<p>It's still rather fast: it can iterate through all the filenames on my
600,000 file filesystem in a few seconds.  But it still needs to rewrite
the entire index file just to add a single filename, which is pretty
nasty; it should just leave the new files in a second "extra index" file
or something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bup could use inotify for <em>really</em> efficient incremental backups.</p>

<p>You could even have your system doing "continuous" backups: whenever a
file changes, we immediately send an image of it to the server.  We could
give the continuous-backup process a really low CPU and I/O priority so
you wouldn't even know it was running.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bup currently has no way to prune <em>old</em> backups.</p>

<p>Because of the way the packfile system works, backups become "entangled"
in weird ways and it's not actually possible to delete one pack
(corresponding approximately to one backup) without risking screwing up
other backups.</p>

<p>git itself has lots of ways of optimizing this sort of thing, but its
methods aren't really applicable here; bup packfiles are just too huge.
We'll have to do it in a totally different way.  There are lots of
options.  For now: make sure you've got lots of disk space :)</p>

<p>Until we fix this, one possible workaround is to just start a new
BUP_DIR occasionally, i.e. bup-2013-10, bup-2013-11...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bup has never been tested on anything but Linux, MacOS, and Windows+Cygwin.</p>

<p>There's nothing that makes it <em>inherently</em> non-portable, though, so
that's mostly a matter of someone putting in some effort.  (For a
"native" Windows port, the most annoying thing is the absence of ssh in
a default Windows installation.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bup needs better documentation.</p>

<p>According to a recent article about bup in Linux Weekly News
(<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/380983/">https://lwn.net/Articles/380983/</a>), "it's a bit short on examples and
a user guide would be nice."  Documentation is the sort of thing that
will never be great unless someone from outside contributes it (since
the developers can never remember which parts are hard to understand).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bup is "relatively speedy" and has "pretty good" compression.</p>

<p>...according to the same LWN article.  Clearly neither of those is good
enough.  We should have awe-inspiring speed and crazy-good compression. 
Must work on that.  Writing more parts in C might help with the speed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bup has no GUI.</p>

<p>Actually, that's not stupid, but you might consider it a limitation. 
There are a bunch of Linux GUI backup programs; someday I expect someone
will adapt one of them to use bup.</p>
