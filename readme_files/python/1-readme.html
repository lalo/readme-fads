and clean, pragmatic design. Thanks for checking it out.</p>
<p>All documentation is in the "docs" directory and online at
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/</a>. If you're just getting started,
here's how we recommend you read the docs:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, read docs/intro/install.txt for instructions on installing Django.</li>
<li>Next, work through the tutorials in order (docs/intro/tutorial01.txt,
docs/intro/tutorial02.txt, etc.).</li>
<li>If you want to set up an actual deployment server, read
docs/howto/deployment/index.txt for instructions.</li>
<li>You'll probably want to read through the topical guides (in docs/topics)
next; from there you can jump to the HOWTOs (in docs/howto) for specific
problems, and check out the reference (docs/ref) for gory details.</li>
<li>See docs/README for instructions on building an HTML version of the docs.</li>
</ul><p>Docs are updated rigorously. If you find any problems in the docs, or think
they should be clarified in any way, please take 30 seconds to fill out a
ticket here: <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket">https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket</a></p>
