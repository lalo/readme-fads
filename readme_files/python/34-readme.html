<p><a href="http://liftoffsoftware.com/Products/GateOne">Gate One</a> is an HTML5 web-based terminal emulator and SSH client.  Top features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No browser plugins required!  Say goodbye to the security problems of Java, Flash, and ActiveX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multi-user and multi-terminal:  Hundreds of simultaneous users and terminals can be served from ho-hum hardware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advanced terminal emulation including support for 256 colors, fancy text styles, and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supports capturing and displaying images and PDFs inline within terminals (see screenshots).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type in your native language!  Gate One supports Unicode, international keyboard layouts, and localized strings (internationalization or i18n).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Natural copy &amp; paste:  Highlight text and use your browser's native context menu.  On Macs you can use ⌘-c and ⌘-v and on Linux desktops you can middle-click-to-paste.  Shift-Insert works too!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terminal sessions can be resumed even if the browser is closed or disconnected.  They can also be resumed from a completely different computer.  You'll never have to worry about the office VPN disconnecting again!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supports server-side logging of user sessions via any combination of syslog, remote syslog, or directly to disk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gate One can be embedded into any web application.  A few lines of JavaScript is all it takes!  There's an interactive tutorial covering how to embed available in the tests directory (hello_embedded).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many authentication mechanisms are supported:  Anonymous, Kerberos (Single Sign-On with Active Directory!), PAM, Google Auth, and there's an OpenID-like WebSocket API for applications embedding Gate One (see the chat app in the tests directory for an example of how it works).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gate One is easy to customize:  Themes and plugins can add features or override just about anything.  In fact, Gate One's SSH functionality is implemented entirely via a plugin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plugins can be written in any combination of Python, JavaScript, and CSS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Gate One server can be stopped &amp; started without users losing their running terminal applications (even SSH sessions stay connected!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SSH plugin allows users to duplicate sessions without having to re-enter their username and password (it re-uses the existing SSH tunnel).  It also supports key-based authentication and includes an SSH identity manager that supports RSA, DSA, ECDSA, and even X.509 certificates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SSH plugin also provides a library of functions that <em>other</em> plugins can use to seamlessly execute background operations on the currently-connected terminal.  You can capture this output from JavaScript and do whatever you want with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bookmarks plugin lets you keep track of <em>all</em> of your hosts with support for tagging, sorting, and includes a super fast search.  It was built to handle thousands of bookmarks and can be used with whatever URLs you want--it isn't limited to SSH!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Logging plugin includes a Log Viewer that allows users to sort, view, and even export recordings of their terminal sessions to self-contained HTML files that can be shared.  Demonstrating anything on the command line can be as simple as performing the task and clicking a button!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Playback plugin allows users to rewind and play back their connected terminal sessions in real-time, just like a video!  This can be done via the playback controls or by holding the shift key while scrolling.</p>
</li>
<li><dl>
<dt>The Convenience plugin adds many convenient capabilities:</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>IPv4 and IPv6 addresses become clickable elements that can perform a reverse DNS lookup.</li>
<li>The output of 'ls -l' is transformed into clickable elements that can perform user and group lookups, convert bytes into human-readable strings, and even tell you what the 'chmod equivalent' is of the permissions field (e.g. clicking on 'crw-rw-rw-' would tell you, "(Character Device) with permissions equivalent to 'chmod 0666'").</li>
<li>Automatic syntax highlighting of syslog messages.</li>
</ul></dd>
</dl></li>
<li>
<p>The Example plugin demonstrates how to write your own plugins and shows off the SSH plugin's exec_remote_command() functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gate One works with Python 2.6+, Python 3, and even pypy!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The daemon that acts as the web server for Gate One is small and light enough to be included in <a href="http://beagleboard.org/bone">embedded devices</a>.</p>

<p>Gate One's termio and terminal Python modules can be used together to automate, screen-scrape, and completely control terminal applications.  The <a href="http://liftoff.github.com/GateOne/Developer/termio.html#termio.BaseMultiplex.expect">expect()</a> function can be used as a replacement for <a href="http://pexpect.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">pexpect</a> that has some additional features and benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be used asynchronously:  It won't block which means it is perfect for executing commands from a web application.</li>
<li>It supports sophisticated decision trees and callbacks:  You can completely re-define all patterns and callbacks on-the-fly based on whatever conditions you want.</li>
