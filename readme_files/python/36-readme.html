<div class="announce instapaper_body " data-path="README" id="readme"><div class="plain"><pre>Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development
and clean, pragmatic design.

All documentation is in the "docs" directory and online at
<a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/">http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/</a>. If you're just getting started, here's
how we recommend you read the docs:

    * First, read docs/intro/install.txt for instructions on installing Django.

    * Next, work through the tutorials in order (docs/intro/tutorial01.txt,
      docs/intro/tutorial02.txt, etc.).

    * If you want to set up an actual deployment server, read
      docs/howto/deployment/index.txt for instructions.

    * You'll probably want to read through the topical guides (in docs/topics)
      next; from there you can jump to the HOWTOs (in docs/howto) for specific
      problems, and check out the reference (docs/ref) for gory details.

Docs are updated rigorously. If you find any problems in the docs, or think they
should be clarified in any way, please take 30 seconds to fill out a ticket
here:
