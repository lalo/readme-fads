Users share not only static files but dynamic objects too. Code is taken as equivalent to contracts ("smart contracts") and hosts check each others compliance.It executes the code on several different machines, runtime libraries, compilers, operating systems etc. in parallel. Signed cryptographic hash are compared/stored for every transaction. Thus, this counters subversion of various components, eliminating the need to trust.</td>

<a href="https://bitbucket.org/travisfw/baseparadigm/">BaseParadigm</a> is anopen source (GPLv3) library for managing a content addressable binarysemantic graph. Content addressability means enabling a number of dataexchange protocols (including p2p) for a developer usingBaseParadigm. Content addressable data is immutable, and so a semanticgraph is necessary for managing updates, annotations, reputation, andnavigational links. BaseParadigm lays the basis for a new paradigm fordata management that can be done offline as much as is desirable, andputs control over data storage, transmission, and processing back inthe hands of the user. Identity management becomes data managementrather than what it is today: contract management with third party webservices. Application interop is simplified from web API support tosimple graph queries. The user's experience is that all their data isavailable all the time in the places they expect.</td>

Encrypts a partition or drive where Windows is installed (pre-boot authentication). Encryption is automatic, real-time (on-the-fly) and transparent. Parallelization and pipelining allow data to be read and written as fast as if the drive was not encrypted. Encryption can be hardware-accelerated on modern processors. Provides plausible deniability, in case an adversary forces you to reveal the password: Hidden volume (steganography) and hidden operating system.
