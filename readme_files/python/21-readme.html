<div class="announce instapaper_body rst" data-path="README.rst" id="readme"><article class="markdown-body entry-content" itemprop="mainContentOfPage"><p>Fabric is a Python (2.5-2.7) library and command-line tool for
streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems
administration tasks.</p>
<p>It provides a basic suite of operations for executing local or remote shell
commands (normally or via <tt>sudo</tt>) and uploading/downloading files, as well as
auxiliary functionality such as prompting the running user for input, or
aborting execution.</p>
<p>Typical use involves creating a Python module containing one or more functions,
then executing them via the <tt>fab</tt> command-line tool. Below is a small but
complete "fabfile" containing a single task:</p>
<pre>
from fabric.api import run

def host_type():
    run('uname -s')
</pre>
<p>Once a task is defined, it may be run on one or more servers, like so:</p>
<pre>
$ fab -H localhost,linuxbox host_type
[localhost] run: uname -s
[localhost] out: Darwin
[linuxbox] run: uname -s
[linuxbox] out: Linux

Done.
Disconnecting from localhost... done.
Disconnecting from linuxbox... done.
</pre>
<p>In addition to use via the <tt>fab</tt> tool, Fabric's components may be imported
into other Python code, providing a Pythonic interface to the SSH protocol
suite at a higher level than that provided by e.g. the <tt>Paramiko</tt> library
(which Fabric itself uses.)</p></article></div>
