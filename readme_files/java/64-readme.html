<p>Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. If you are building, testing, publishing, and deploying software on any platform, Gradle offers a flexible model that can support the entire development lifecycle from compiling and packaging code to publishing web sites. Gradle has been designed to support build automation across multiple languages and platforms including Java, Scala, Android, C/C++, and Groovy, and is closely integrated with development tools and continuous integration servers including Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Jenkins.</p>

<p>You can download released versions and nightly build artifacts from: <a href="http://gradle.org/downloads">http://gradle.org/downloads</a></p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-building" class="anchor" href="#building" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building</h2>

<p>Naturally, Gradle builds itself with Gradle. Gradle provides an innovative <a href="http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html">wrapper</a> that allows you to work with a Gradle build without having to manually install Gradle. The wrapper is a batch script on Windows and a shell script on other operating systems.</p>

<p>You should use the wrapper to build the gradle project. Generally, you should use the wrapper for any wrapper-enabled project because it guarantees building with the Gradle version that the build was intended to use.</p>

<p>To build the entire Gradle project, you should run the following in the root of the checkout.</p>

<pre><code>./gradlew build
</code></pre>

<p>This will compile all the code, generate all the documentation and run all the tests. It can take up to an hour on a fast machine because we have thousands of tests, including integration tests that exercise virtually every Gradle feature. Among the things we test are: compatibility across versions, validity of samples and Javadoc snippets, daemon process capabilities, etc.</p>

<a name="user-content-installing-from-source" class="anchor" href="#installing-from-source" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing from source</h3>

<p>To create an install from the source tree you can run either of the following:</p>

<pre><code>./gradlew install -Pgradle_installPath=/usr/local/gradle-source-build
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a minimal installation; just what's needed to run Gradle (i.e. no docs). Note that the <code>-Pgradle_installPath</code> denotes where to install to. </p>

<p>You can then build a Gradle based project with this installation:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/local/gradle-source-build/bin/gradle «some task»
</code></pre>

<p>To create a full installation (includes docs):</p>

<pre><code>./gradlew installAll -Pgradle_installPath=/usr/local/gradle-source-build
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-working-with-subprojects" class="anchor" href="#working-with-subprojects" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Working with subprojects</h3>

<p>The Gradle build uses Gradle's ability to customize the logical structure of a multiproject build. All of the build's subprojects are in the <code>subprojects/</code> directory and are mapped to top level children in <a href="https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/settings.gradle">settings.gradle</a>.</p>

<p>This means that to build just the <code>core</code> subproject (that lives in <code>subprojects/core</code>) you would run:</p>

<pre><code>./gradlew core:build
</code></pre>

<p>Or to build the docs:</p>

<pre><code>./gradlew docs:build
</code></pre>

<p>And so on.</p>

<a name="user-content-contributing" class="anchor" href="#contributing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contributing</h2>

<p>If you're looking to contribute to Gradle or provide a patch/pull request, you can find info on how to get in touch with the developers at <a href="http://gradle.org/development">http://gradle.org/development</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-contributing-code" class="anchor" href="#contributing-code" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contributing Code</h3>

<p>This is a complicated topic and the Gradle development team are happy to help anybody get started working with the Gradle code base, so don't hesitate to get in touch with the developers if you need help working with the finer points of the build.</p>

<p>If you are simply wanting to fix something or adding a small minor feature, it is usually good enough to simply make your change to the code and then run the <code>check</code> task for that subproject. So if the patch was to the <code>launcher</code> package for example, you can run:</p>

<pre><code>./gradlew launcher:check
</code></pre>

<p>To run all of the tests and code quality checks for that module.</p>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-contributing-documentation" class="anchor" href="#contributing-documentation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contributing Documentation</h3>

<p>Please see the readme in the <a href="https://github.com/gradle/gradle/tree/master/subprojects/docs">docs subproject</a>.</p>

<a name="user-content-opening-in-your-ide" class="anchor" href="#opening-in-your-ide" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Opening in your IDE</h2>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-intellij-idea" class="anchor" href="#intellij-idea" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>IntelliJ IDEA</h3>

<p>To open the Gradle project in IDEA, simply run the following task from the root:</p>

<pre><code>./gradlew idea
</code></pre>

<p>This will generate appropriate IDEA metadata so that the project can be opened from within IDEA.</p>

<p>Note that due to an IDEA glitch, the first build of Gradle from IDEA will fail. Launching a second build fixes the compilation error.</p>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-eclipse" class="anchor" href="#eclipse" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Eclipse</h3>

<p>The Gradle project is not currently buildable in Eclipse. This is something that will be rectified in the future.</p>

<p>You can try running:</p>

<pre><code>./gradlew eclipse
</code></pre>

<p>This command generates Eclipse metadata that allows importing the project into Eclipse. However, you will have to do some manual fixes to the project's setup to make it work.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/gradle">Gradle(Enide) Eclipse plugin</a>, you can import as general plugin or prepare before with <code>./gradlew eclipse</code>. </p>

<p>Build is run via right-click on <code>build.gralde</code> <kbd>Run As -&gt; gradle build Gradle Build</kbd></p></article></div>
