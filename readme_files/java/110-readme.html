<p>If you've made it here, chances are you are not quite as satisfied with the Android application framework as you could be. Same for us, that's why we created ignition.</p>

<p>Ignition helps you getting your Android applications off the ground quickly, by offering ready-to-use components and utility classes that wrap a lot of the boilerplate that's involved when writing Android apps. Areas covered by ignition encompass:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>UI components such as widgets, adapters, dialogs, and more</li>
<li>An HTTP wrapper library that allows you to write simple yet robust networking code</li>
<li>A class to load remote images off the web and cache them</li>
<li>A simple yet effective caching framework (caches to memory and disk, anything from HTTP responses to entire object trees)</li>
<li>Several helper classes for easier API level backwards compatibility, Intents, diagnostics, and more</li>
<li>A friendlier and more robust implementation of AsyncTask</li>
</ul><p>Ignition is split up into three sub-projects.</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>
<strong>ignition-core.</strong> This is an Android library project that is compiled straight into your apps. This allows you to re-use views and shared resources right in your own code.</li>
<li>
<strong>ignition-support.</strong> This is a standard Java library project, deployed as an ordinary JAR. It contains most of the utility classes. You can use this independently of the core module.</li>
<li>
<strong>ignition-location.</strong> This is an Android AspectJ library project that is compiled straight into your apps. It allows your location-aware applications to always have the most recent location without the need to handle location updates within your Activity.</li>

<a name="user-content-documentation" class="anchor" href="#documentation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Documentation</h2>

<p>We decided to not write exhaustive documentation, since it would get outdated frequently. Instead, the project is documented both via <a href="https://github.com/mttkay/ignition/wiki/Sample-applications">sample applications</a> that are part of the build, as well as online JavaDoc:</p>
