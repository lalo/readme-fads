<p>BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system for on-line learning.  We believe that every student with a web browser should have access to a high-quality on-line learning experience.  We intend to make that possible with BigBlueButton. </p>

<p>BigBlueButton supports real-time sharing of slides (PDF and any document readable by OpenOffice), webcams, whiteboard, chat, voice over IP (using FreeSWITCH), and desktop. It can record and playback all content shared in a session.  The BigBlueButton project is is supported by a <a href="http://www.bigbluebutton.org/support/">community of developers</a> that care about good design and a streamlined user experience. </p>

<p>The use cases for BigBlueButton are</p>
