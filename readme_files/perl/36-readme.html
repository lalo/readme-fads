<p>This repository's <code>gh-pages</code> branch is the starting point for a bootcamp website:
it contains a template for your bootcamp's home page
and the shared lesson materials we have developed.
The sections below explain:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>  how GitHub turns a repository into a web site,</li>
<li>  how you can build a website for your bootcamp using this repo as a starting point,</li>
<li>  what lessons we have,</li>
<li>  where they're located, and</li>
<li>  how to add new lessons.</li>

</li>
</ul><p><strong>Note:</strong>
If you are teaching Git in your bootcamp,
you should create <em>two</em> repositories:
one for your bootcamp's website,
and one for learners to clone and update during your lessons.
You should not try to use the same repo for both purposes because:</p>

<ol class="task-list">
<li> your website repo is probably going to be fairly large, and</li>
<li> you don't want a learner accidentally overwriting your lessons
while you're trying to teach.</li>
</ol><p>You should also run <code>make check</code> before pushing changes to your <code>index.html</code> home page
to your repository.
If you don't have Make installed,
you can run the same checks using:</p>

<pre><code>python bin/swc_index_validator.py ./index.html
</code></pre>

<p>This checks that the bootcamp's instructors are listed,
that a contact email address has been set up,
and so on.</p>

<a name="user-content-background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h2>

<p>There are a few things you need to know
in order to understand why we do things the way we do.
Most of them are specific to GitHub,
rather than Git itself.</p>

<ol class="task-list">
<li><p>Git uses the term "clone" to mean
"a copy of a repository".
GitHub uses the term "fork" to mean,
"a copy of a GitHub-hosted repo that is also hosted on GitHub",
and the term "clone" to mean
"a copy of a GitHub-hosted repo that's located on someone else's machine".
In both cases,
the duplicate has a remote called <code>origin</code>
that points to the original repo;
other remotes can be added manually.</p></li>
<li><p>A user on GitHub can only have one fork of a particular repo.
This is a problem for us because
an instructor may be involved in several bootcamps,
each of which has its own website repo.
Those website repositories ought to be forks of this one,
but since GitHub doesn't allow that,
we've had to find a workaround.</p></li>
<li><p>If a repository has a file called <code>README.md</code> in its root directory,
GitHub displays that file on the repository's home page.</p></li>
<li><p>If a repository has a branch called <code>gh-pages</code>
(which stands for "GitHub pages"),
then GitHub uses the HTML and Markdown files in that branch
to create a website for the repository.
If the repository's URL is <code>http://github.com/darwin/finches</code>,
the URL for the website is <code>http://darwin.github.io/finches</code>.</p></li>
<li>
<p>If an HTML or Markdown file has a header consisting of three dashes,
some data about the page,
and three more dashes:</p>

<pre><code>---
key: value
other_key: other_value
---
stuff in the page
</code></pre>

<p>then GitHub doesn't just copy the file over verbatim.
Instead,
it runs the file through a translator called Jekyll
that looks for specially-formatted commands embedded in the file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Commands can be embedded in the body of a page.
One is <code>{% include somefile.html %}</code>,
which tells Jekyll to copy the contents of <code>somefile.html</code> into the file being translated;
this is used to create standard headers and footers for pages.
Another is <code>{{variable}}</code>:
when Jekyll see this,
it replaces it with the value of <code>variable</code>.
This is used to insert things like a contact email address and the URL for our Twitter account.</p></li>
<li><p>Jekyll gets variables from two places:
a file called <code>_config.yml</code> located in the repo's root directory,
and the header of each individual page.
Variables from <code>_config.yml</code> are put in an object called <code>site</code>,
and referred to as <code>site.variable</code>,
so <code>{{site.twitter_name}}</code> in a page is replaced by <code>@swcarpentry</code>.
Variables from the page's header are put in an object called <code>page</code>,
and referred to as <code>page.variable</code>,
so if a page's header defines a variable called <code>venue</code>,
<code>{{page.venue}}</code> is replaced by "Euphoric State University"
(or whatever value the variable has).</p></li>
<li><p>If a page uses <code>{% include something.html %}</code> to include a snippet of HTML,
Jekyll looks in a directory called <code>_includes</code> to find <code>something.html</code>.
It always looks there,
and nowhere else,
so anything we want people to be able to include in their pages
has to be stored in <code>_includes</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>A repository can have another special directory called <code>_layouts</code>.
If a page like <code>index.html</code> has a variable called <code>layout</code>,
and that variable's value is <code>standard.html</code>,
Jekyll loads the file <code>_layouts/standard.html</code>
and copies the content of <code>index.html</code> into it,
then expands the result.
This is used to give the pages in a site a uniform appearance.</p></li>
</ol><p>We have created three standard layouts for bootcamp pages:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><code>bootcamp.html</code> is used for bootcamps' home pages,
and is the layout for the <code>index.html</code> page in your repo's root directory.
That <code>index.html</code> page's header must
<a href="#variables">define several variables</a>
in order for your bootcamp to be included in our main website.</p></li>
<li><p><code>lesson.html</code> is used to lay out pages for individual lessons.
All of the lessons in this repository use it
to ensure uniform look and feel.</p></li>
<li><p><code>slides.html</code> is used to format slideshows.
It is still under development.</p></li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="user-content-getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To create a website for a new bootcamp:</p>

<ol class="task-list">
<li><p>Create a <a href="https://github.com/new">new repository on GitHub</a>
with a name like YYYY-MM-DD-site, e.g., <code>2014-03-31-esu</code>.
This repository must <em>not</em> be a fork of an existing repository
because as mentioned earlier,
GitHub only allows a user to fork a repository once,
but many instructors are involved in several bootcamps.
Please use the same ID for your bootcamp
that the Software Carpentry admins are using to identify it
(i.e.,
if the admins called the bootcamp <code>2014-03-31-esu</code>,
please <em>don't</em> call your repo <code>euphoric-march-2014</code>),
and please use all lower-case
(i.e., '2014-03-31-esu' instead of '2014-03-31-ESU').</p></li>
<li><p>Clone this new repository to your local machine and <code>cd</code> into it.
You can ignore the warning about cloning an empty repository:
it won't stay empty long.</p></li>
</ol><p><a href="img/readme/step1.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/readme/step1.png" alt="Step 1" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>

<ol class="task-list">
<li>
<p>Add the repository <code>https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc.git</code> as a remote named <code>swc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote add swc https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc.git
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol><p><a href="img/readme/step2.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/readme/step2.png" alt="Step 2" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>

<ol class="task-list">
<li>
<p>Create a new branch in the local clone named <code>gh-pages</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b gh-pages
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pull content from the template repository's <code>gh-pages</code> branch into your desktop repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ git pull swc gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>This may take a minute or two.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the <code>swc</code> remote so that you don't accidentally try
to push your changes to the main <code>bc</code> repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote rm swc
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Edit <code>index.html</code> to create the bootcamp home page.
In particular,
double-check
<a href="#variables">the variables in the page's header</a>,
as these are used to update the main website,
and make sure the <a href="#website-content">website content</a> is correct.
You can use the script <code>./bin/swc_index_validator.py</code>
to check <code>index.html</code> for problems
by running the command <code>make check</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Edit <code>_includes/setup.html</code> to provide software installation instructions for bootcamp attendees.
This is described in more detail in the section on <a href="#website-content">website content</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="#previewing-the-site">Preview your changes</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Replace the content of this <code>README.md</code> file with a line or two describing your bootcamp.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Push content to your YYYY-MM-DD-site repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin gh-pages
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol><p>As soon as your repo has been pushed to GitHub, GitHub will render your pages
at the url:</p>

<pre><code>http://{your-github-username}.github.io/YYYY-MM-DD-site/
</code></pre>

<p>You may update your bootcamp's website whenever you want.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-previewing-the-site" class="anchor" href="#previewing-the-site" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Previewing the Site</h2>

<p>To preview your bootcamp's page(s),
go into its root directory and run:</p>

<pre><code>$ make site
</code></pre>

<p>This will run <code>jekyll</code> to create the directory <code>./_site</code>.
The <code>index.html</code> page in this directory,
<code>./_site/index.html</code>,
should have the Software Carpentry look and feel
and the information about your bootcamp.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
you will need to install Jekyll 1.0.3 or later in order to preview things locally.
If you have Ruby installed on your computer,
this <em>should</em> be as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>$ gem install github-pages
</code></pre>

<p>or if that doesn't work:</p>

<pre><code>$ gem install jekyll
$ gem install kramdown
</code></pre>

<p>(We use Kramdown for translating Markdown instead of the default
Redcarpet because Kramdown will handle Markdown inside HTML blocks).</p>

<p>On OS X, we suggest you use a recent Ruby to get access to these.
If you don't have Homebrew or MacPorts installed,
here's a quick recipe to get started using HomeBrew.</p>

<pre><code>$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
$ brew install ruby
</code></pre>

<p>and then <code>gem install</code> as above.
If you don't have <code>make</code> in your machine,
you can build the preview with:</p>

<pre><code>$ jekyll -t build -d _site
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-variables" class="anchor" href="#variables" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Variables</h2>

<p>Your bootcamp's <code>index.html</code> page
(which uses the <code>bootcamp.html</code> layout from the <code>_layouts</code> directory)
<em>must</em> define the following values in its YAML header:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>  <code>layout</code> must be <code>bootcamp</code>.</li>
<li>  <code>root</code> is the path to the repository's root directory.
This is '.' if the page is in the root directory
(which <code>index.html</code> is).
In other pages,
<code>root</code> is '..' if the page is one directory down,
'../..' if it is two levels down,
and so on.</li>
<li>  <code>venue</code> is the name of the institution or group hosting the bootcamp.</li>
<li>  <code>address</code> is the bootcamp's street address.</li>
<li>  <code>country</code> must be a hyphenated country name like 'United-States'.
This is used to look up flags for display in the main web site;
see the <code>assets/flags</code> directory in the <code>site</code> repo for a full list of valid names.</li>
<li>  <code>latlng</code> is the latitude and longitude of the bootcamp site
(so we can put a pin on our map).</li>
<li>  <code>humandate</code> is the human-friendly dates for the bootcamp (e.g., Jul 3-4, 2015).
Please use three- or four-letter month names and abbreviations
(e.g., <code>Dec</code> instead of <code>December</code>).</li>
<li>  <code>startdate</code> is the bootcamp's starting date in YYYY-MM-DD format.</li>
<li>  <code>enddate</code> is the bootcamp's ending date in the same format.
If your bootcamp is only one day long,
the <code>enddate</code> field can be deleted.</li>
<li>  <code>registration</code> is <code>open</code> (if anyone is allowed to sign up)
or <code>restricted</code> (if only some people are allowed to take part).
Please do <em>not</em> put HTML or links in here to explain
who's allowed to enrol or how to go about doing it;
that should go in the main body of your page.</li>
<li>  <code>instructor</code> is a comma-separated list of instructor names.
This must be enclosed in square brackets,
as in <code>["Alan Turing","Grace Hopper"]</code>
</li>
<li>  <code>helper</code> is a comma-separated list of helper names.
This must be enclosed in square brackets,
as in <code>["John von Neumann"]</code>
</li>
<li>  <code>contact</code> is the contact email address to use for your bootcamp.</li>
</ul><p>The header may optionally define the following:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>  <code>eventbrite</code> is the multi-digit Eventbrite registration key.
If you are using Eventbrite,
the admins will set this key for you.
If you are using something else for registration,
it may be deleted.</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="user-content-website-content" class="anchor" href="#website-content" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Website Content</h2>

<p>The body of <code>index.html</code> contains
an explanation of what a bootcamp is and how it runs,
followed by setup instructions for our standard software.
There is an explanatory comment for each section of this page;
reorganize, rewrite, or delete the material as you think best.</p>

<p><code>index.html</code> depends on five HTML files in the <code>_includes</code> directory:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>  <code>header.html</code>: material for the page's head.</li>
<li>  <code>banner.html</code>: the generic banner with the Software Carpentry logo.</li>
<li>  <code>footer.html</code>: the generic footer with links to Software Carpentry's web presence.</li>
<li>  <code>javascript.html</code>: JQuery and Bootstrap Javascript.</li>
<li>  <code>setup.html</code>: common setup instructions.</li>
</ul><p>You normally won't need to worry about the first four ---
they're included in the right places by our standard layouts ---
but you will probably want to edit the fifth.
In particular,
if you are teaching a Python bootcamp,
you should delete the instructions for installing R,
and vice versa.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-lesson-material" class="anchor" href="#lesson-material" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lesson Material</h2>

<ol class="task-list">
<li> The current material for novices is in the directories under <code>novice</code>.
The shell and Git materials are written in Markdown,
while the Python and SQL use the IPython Notebook.</li>
<li> New material for intermediate learners is currently under development
in directories under <code>intermediate</code>.</li>
<li> Our old lesson material
is in the <code>lessons</code> directory.
We plan to retire it in Spring 2014,</li>
</ol><p>As explained <a href="#building-things">below</a>,
you can use <code>make</code> to compile this material in the way that GitHub does
when changes are committed to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-building-things" class="anchor" href="#building-things" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building Things</h2>

<p>GitHub automatically runs Jekyll
to regenerate the pretty HTML versions of our content
every time changes are pushed to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch of this repository.
We use <code>make</code> to imitate that process locally
so that people can preview changes before committing.
We also use <code>make</code> to automate a handful of other tasks,
such as converting IPython Notebooks from <code>.ipynb</code> format to Markdown (<code>.md</code>)
so that Jekyll can convert them to HTML.</p>

<p>Most of the commands to rebuild things are in <code>Makefile</code>;
run the command <code>make</code> on its own to get a list of targets,
and <code>make site</code> to re-run Jekyll to preview your site
(which Jekyll will put in the <code>_site</code> directory).
You can also run <code>make check</code> to run a Python script
that checks whether <code>index.html</code>'s variables are formatted correctly,
and <code>make clean</code> to clean up all generated files.</p>

<p>The commands used to turn IPython Notebooks into Markdown files
are stored in a separate Makefile called <code>ipynb.mk</code>.
This separation ensures that people can rebuild the site
even if they don't have IPython installed
(which R instructors might not);
it also guarantees that <code>make</code> won't try to regenerate Markdown after a Git pull
(which might change the timestamps on files,
but not actually change their contents).
If we add more languages and file formats in future,
we may also create separate Makefiles for them.</p>
