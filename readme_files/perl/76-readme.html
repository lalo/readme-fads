<p>Azimuth is a simple, elegant, and fast CMS built using meteor.js.</p>

<p>This is the tracking repository for the various Meteorite packages that make up Azimuth.  If you'd just like to get running with Azimuth, visit the <a href="http://azimuthc.ms/">home page</a> for simple instructions.</p>

<p>If you'd like to run Azimuth from git, clone this repository (make sure to clone using <code>git clone --recursive https://github.com/mcrider/azimuth.git</code> or otherwise initialize the submodules in <code>/packages</code>) and keep on reading...</p>

<p><strong><em>Note: Azimuth is currently in early alpha; I'm still working out code design and many features are not yet implemented.</em></strong></p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Install meteor.js: <code>curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh</code>
</li>
<li>Install meteorite: <code>sudo npm install -g meteorite</code>
</li>
</ul><p>You can then run Azimuth by cloning this repository and running <code>mrt</code> from the root directory.  This will make Azimuth accessible from http://localhost:3000 by default.  I recommend forking this repository and pushing any changes to your forked repo (and please feel free to make pull requests with your custom blocks, pages, or core fixes).</p>

<p>To test different front-end frameworks or themes, add/remove them like you would normally.  E.g. if you'd like to go from using Bootstrap to Foundation, run</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><code>mrt remove azimuth-views-bootstrap</code></li>
<li>
<code>mrt remove azimuth-theme-bootstrap-flatBlue</code> (or whichever theme you're using, if any)</li>
<li><code>mrt add azimuth-views-foundation</code></li>
</ul><p>To administer Azimuth, create a user account -- the first user account will be the admin user.  From there you can edit your site from the admin menu in the top right corner of the page.</p>
