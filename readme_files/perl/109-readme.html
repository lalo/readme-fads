<p>This repository contains an ever evolving proposal and a
functioning prototype for a Meta Object Protocol, or MOP,
to be perhaps included in a future version of Perl 5.</p>

<p>The core goal is to provide a simple, lightweight and
highly Perl-ish MOP that will provide the same degree of
flexibility and TIMTOWTDI of the original Perl 5 object
model, but with more a formalized class model.</p>

<p>This proposal will be developed in the open and comments
are welcome.</p>

<a name="user-content-prototype-notes-" class="anchor" href="#prototype-notes-" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Prototype notes ...</h2>

<p>This is a prototype of the proposed MOP for Perl 5. The
main purpose of this prototypes is to work out a few
of key things; the syntax/semantics of the object
system, the underlying MOP API and the extensibility
of the MOP itself.</p>

<p>Ideally this will also provide the starts of a test
suite that can be ported to the final implementation.</p>

<p>This prototype, for the most part, accurately
reflects the proposed syntax/semanitics of the object
system, however the implementation is another story.
Basically, any implementation found in these folders
should <em>NEVER</em> be considered a proposal for a <em>specific</em>
implementation technique. In fact, much of what you might
find in here will likely use scary and tricky techniques
to accomplish desired behaviors, and it would be
expected that a real implementation would <em>NOT</em> use
such scary and tricky techniques.</p></article></div>
