<p>SM is a system scripting &amp; management framework together with a domain
specific language API (DSL) for managing software, systems and stacks!</p>

<h1>
<a name="user-content-goal" class="anchor" href="#goal" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goal</h1>

<p>SM delivers an extensible scripting framework providing a very robust DSL API.
A primary tenet of SM is that it must handle as much pain as possible, so you don't have to!
With SM's DSL APIs, you can quickly create your own high-quality extensions,
and expose their commands through SM's command line interface (CLI).</p>

<a name="user-content-architecture" class="anchor" href="#architecture" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Architecture</h1>

<p>SM itself is a scripting framework that enables very rich DSL commands known as
'apis'. SM lets you use the DSL APIs to painlessly write powerful 'extensions',
which are essentially named sets of scripts (directories!). With SM, you'll find
you can install and manage a multitude of extensions - and even entire sets of
extensions - providing unprecedented levels of control and automation
productivity that are unleashed by the creative abilities of SM's energetic
community of extension authors :)</p>

<a name="user-content-installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h1>

<p>The easiest way to install is to use following oneliner:</p>

<pre><code>curl -L https://get.smf.sh | sh
</code></pre>

<h1>
<a name="user-content-manual" class="anchor" href="#manual" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Manual</h1>

<p>The manual may be downloaded as a PDF. Keep in mind that it is a work in
progress. Suggestions on improving the manual are most welcome.</p>

<p>The latest version of the manual is kept at the following url:</p>

<pre><code>https://smf.sh/docs/sm-manual.pdf
</code></pre>

<p>Anytime updates are made to the manual a new version is pushed to that url.</p>

<a name="user-content-creating-extensions" class="anchor" href="#creating-extensions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating Extensions</h1>

<p>There are only a few requirements when creating your own SM extensions.
The extension must live in a dedicated directory. Within this directory are
(at least) the subdirectory bin/, containing at least one executable file called 'help'.</p>

<p>Additionally, in the root of the extension directory you must include a text file called VERSION,
with a version number that follows semantic versioning convention (<a href="http://semver.org/">http://semver.org/</a>);
that is, in the format of X.Y.Z, where X,Y and Z are positive integers.</p>

<p>An extension must also have a README file, in which you should explain your
extension's primary purpose, and any special considerations to be kept in mind
when using it.</p>

<p>The contents of the bin directory can be <em>any</em> executable file. This means, for
example, that C-compiled binaries, Ruby Scripts, python, lua, etc... may all be
used according to your requirements and preferences.</p>

<p>Of course, the extensions <em>I</em> write are generally in bash; but you can bring your
own implements of choice to the SM party ;)</p>

<p>Additionally, if you write your extensions in bash, a nice DSL is automatically loaded for you.
You can read more about the DSL in the online documentation.</p>
