<p>This is the first purely functional implementation of <a href="http://cr.yp.to/critbit.html">crit-bit
trees</a> that I'm aware of.</p>

<p>A crit-bit tree is a key/value container that allows efficient lookups
and ordered traversal for data that can be represented as a string of
bits.</p>

<p>This package exists in part with education in mind:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><p>The core data structures are simple.</p></li>
<li><p>The core algorithms are easy to grasp.</p></li>
<li><p>I have intentionally structured the source to be easy to follow and
extend.</p></li>
<li><p>Originally, I <em>deliberately</em> left the package incomplete.  (It has
since been substantially fleshed out.)  Ever thought to yourself,
"I'd write a bit of Haskell if only I had a project to work on"?
Well, here's your chance!  I will set aside time to review your code
and answer what questions I can.</p></li>
</ul><p>Education aside, crit-bit trees offer some interesting features
compared to other key/value container types in Haskell.</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><p>For some operations, they are much faster than <code>Data.Map</code> from the
<code>containers</code> package, while for others, they are slower.</p></li>
<li><p>Compared to <code>Data.HashMap</code>, you get about the same lookup
performance, but also some features that a hash-based structure
can't provide: prefix-based search, efficient neighbour lookup,
ordered storage.</p></li>
</ul><p>Of course crit-bit trees have some downsides, too. For example,
building a tree from randomly ordered inputs is somewhat slow, and of
course the set of usable key types is small (only types that can be
interpreted as bitstrings "for free").</p>

<p>Compared to the most easily findable crit-bit tree code you'll come
across that's <a href="https://github.com/glk/critbit">written in C</a>, the core
of this library has a lot less accidental complexity, and so may be
easier to understand. It also handles arbitrary binary data that will
cause the C library to go wrong.</p>

<a name="user-content-how-to-contribute" class="anchor" href="#how-to-contribute" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to contribute</h1>

<p>I've purposely published this package in an incomplete state, and I'd
like your help to round it out.  In return, you get to learn a little
Haskell, have your code reviewed by someone who wants to see you
succeed, and contribute to a rather nifty library.</p>

<p>Do you need any prior experience with Haskell to get started? No! All
you need is curiosity and the ability to learn from context. Oh, and a
github account.</p>

<p>My aim with this library is drop-in API compatibility with the widely
used Haskell <a href="https://github.com/haskell/containers"><code>containers</code></a>
library, which has two happy consequences:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><p>There are lots of functions to write!</p></li>
<li><p>In almost every case, you'll find a pre-existing function in
<code>containers</code> that (from a user's perspective) does exactly what its
counterparts in <em>this</em> library ought to do.</p></li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="user-content-getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting started</h2>

<p>If you want to contribute or play around, please use the most modern
version of the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell Platform</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have the Platform installed, there are just a few more steps.</p>

<p>Set up your local database of known open source Haskell packages.</p>

<pre><code>cabal update
</code></pre>

<p>Both the new <code>cabal</code> command and <code>cabal-dev</code> will install to
<code>$HOME/.cabal/bin</code>, so put that directory at the front of your shell's
search path before you continue.</p>

<p>Get the <code>critbit</code> source.</p>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/bos/critbit
</code></pre>

<p>Set up a sandbox.</p>

<p>The first time through, you may need to download and install a ton of
dependencies, so hang in there.</p>

<pre><code>cd critbit
cabal sandbox init
cabal install \
--enable-tests \
--enable-benchmarks \
    --only-dependencies \
-j
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>-j</code> flag above tells <code>cabal</code> to use all of your CPUs, so even the
initial build shouldn't take more than a few minutes.</p>

<p>To actually build:</p>

<pre><code>cabal build
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-running-the-test-suite" class="anchor" href="#running-the-test-suite" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Running the test suite</h2>

<p>Once you've built the code, you can run the entire test suite fairly
quickly.  This takes about 30 seconds on my oldish 8-core Mac laptop:</p>

<pre><code>dist/build/tests/tests +RTS -N
</code></pre>

<p>(The <code>+RTS -N</code> above tells GHC's runtime system to use all available
cores.)</p>

<p>If you're feeling impatient, run a subset of the test suite:</p>

<pre><code>dist/build/tests/tests -t properties/map/bytestring +RTS -N
</code></pre>

<p>And if you want to explore, the <code>tests</code> program accepts a <code>--help</code>
option. Try it out.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-running-benchmarks" class="anchor" href="#running-benchmarks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Running benchmarks</h2>

<p>It is just as easy to benchmark stuff as to test it.</p>

<p>First, you need a dictionary. If your system doesn't have a file named
<code>/usr/share/dict/words</code>, you can <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/%7Eola/ap/linuxwords">download a dictionary
here</a>.</p>

<p>If you've downloaded a dictionary, tell the benchmark
suite where to find it by setting the <code>WORDS</code> environment variable.</p>

<pre><code>export WORDS=/my/path/to/linuxwords
</code></pre>

<p>You can then run benchmarks and generate a report. For instance, this
runs every benchmark that begins with <code>bytestring/lookup</code>.</p>

<pre><code>dist/build/benchmarks/benchmarks -o lookup.html \
    bytestring/lookup
</code></pre>

<p>Open the <code>lookup.html</code> file in your browser. <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/bos/critbit/blob/master/doc/criterion-sample-lookup.html">Here's an
example</a>
of what to expect.</p>

<p>As with <code>tests</code>, run the <code>benchmarks</code> program with <code>--help</code> if you
want to do some exploring.</p>

<p>Okay, so you've bought into this idea, and would like to try writing a
patch. How to begin?</p>

<p>I've generally tried to write commits with a view to being readable,
so there are examples you can follow.</p>

<p>For instance, <a href="https://github.com/bos/critbit/commit/48438b48ca9bc5d96c1987afe7acdf4dada823f3">here's the commit where I added the <code>keys</code>
function</a>. This
commit follows a simple pattern:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/bos/critbit/commit/48438b48ca9bc5d96c1987afe7acdf4dada823f3#L0L91">Uncomment the export</a> of the function.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/bos/critbit/commit/48438b48ca9bc5d96c1987afe7acdf4dada823f3#L0R503">Write the function
definition</a>.
In this case, the documentation is taken almost verbatim from the
corresponding function in <a href="https://github.com/haskell/containers/blob/342a95002822cca56f2d5b086cdd5a98592d5c10/Data/Map/Base.hs#L1889">the <code>Data.Map</code>
module</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/bos/critbit/commit/48438b48ca9bc5d96c1987afe7acdf4dada823f3#L2R108">Write a
test</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/bos/critbit/commit/48438b48ca9bc5d96c1987afe7acdf4dada823f3#L2R124">make sure it gets
run</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/bos/critbit/commit/48438b48ca9bc5d96c1987afe7acdf4dada823f3#L1R179">Add an entry to the benchmark
suite</a>
so it's easy to see how this compares to other key/value map types.</p></li>
</ul><p>Naturally, you'll follow the prevailing coding and formatting style.
If you forget, I'll be sad and offer you only a terse "fix your
formatting" review, and then you'll be sad too.</p>

<p>Please follow the guidelines below, as they make it easier to review
your pull request and deal with your commits afterwards.</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><p>One logical idea per commit! If you want to add five functions,
that's fine, but please spread them across five commits.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not reorganize or refactor unrelated code in a commit whose
purpose is to add new code.</p></li>
<li><p>When you add a new function, add its tests and benchmarks in the
same commit.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Do not add trailing whitespace</b>. Follow the same formatting
and naming conventions as you already see in the code around you.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep your maximum line length at 80 columns for everything except
lines of example code in documentation.</p></li>
</ul><p>(If you can't follow the guidelines, there's a good chance I'll ask
you to fix your commits and resubmit them.)</p></article></div>
