<p>Hubris is a bridge between Ruby and Haskell, between love and bondage,
between slothful indolence and raw, blazing speed. Hubris will wash
your car, lie to your boss, and salvage your love life. If you are 
very, very lucky, it might also let you get some functional goodness 
into your ruby programs through the back door.</p>

<p>I probably don't have to say this, but patches are very much
welcome. If you have trouble installing it, tell me, and help me
improve the docs.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-content-synopsis" class="anchor" href="#synopsis" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Synopsis</h2>

<p>The best docs, as ever, are in the tests, but as a quick precis, you
can use it a little like this:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'hubris'</span> <span class="c1"># best line ever</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Target</span>
  <span class="n">hubris</span> <span class="ss">:inline</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="s2">"triple::Int-&gt;Int; triple n = 3*n"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">t</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Target</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">triple</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">#=&gt; 30</span>
</pre></div>

<p>There are a few restrictions. All functions take one argument and
return one value: this shouldn't be a major problem because you can
pass arrays of arguments in if you need more. Hubris can currently
handle numbers, strings, basic types (like nil, true and false),
arrays and hashes. There will probably be some Ruby structures
(modules, regular expressions, etc) that won't ever be handled
natively unless someone can convince me it's a sensible thing to do.</p>

<p>Hubris will refuse to compile Haskell code that produces any
warnings. You can suppress this admittedly fairly strict behaviour by
passing the ":no_strict =&gt; true" flag, but in your heart of hearts
you'll know you've done the wrong thing.</p>

<p>There are also two other modes:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="n">hubris</span> <span class="ss">:source</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"MyCoolModule.hs"</span>
</pre></div>

<p>which loads a source file on disk (in the same directory as your ruby),
and</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="n">hubris</span> <span class="ss">:module</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Data.ByteString"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:packages</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">"bytestring"</span><span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>which will load the Data.ByteString module which is installed on the
system. In this case, we also need to let the Haskell side know that
we'll be using the "bytestring" package, so we pass that too: You may
need to load extra packages with :inline and :source as well, and
that's supported.</p>
