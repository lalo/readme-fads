<div class="announce instapaper_body md" data-path="README.md" id="readme"><article class="markdown-body entry-content" itemprop="mainContentOfPage"><p>We have retired the initial release of Snowflake and working on open sourcing
the next version based on
<a href="https://twitter.github.io/twitter-server/">Twitter-server</a>, in a form that can
run anywhere without requiring Twitter's own infrastructure services.</p>

<p>The initial version, released in 2010, was based on Apache Thrift and it
predated <a href="https://twitter.github.io/finagle/">Finagle</a>, our building
block for RPC services at Twitter.  The Snowflake we're using internally is a
full rewrite and heavily relies on existing infrastructure at Twitter to run.
We cannot commit to a date but we're doing our best to add necessary features to
make Snowflake fit for many environments outside of Twitter.</p>

<p>Source code is still in the repository and is reachable from
<a href="https://github.com/twitter/snowflake/releases/tag/snowflake-2010">snowflake-2010</a>
tag.</p>

<p>We won't be accepting pull requests or responding to issues for the retired
release.</p></article></div>
