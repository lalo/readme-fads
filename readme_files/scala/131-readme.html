<p>This repository contains the data from the <strong>Fall 2013</strong> "progfun" survey, and the source code for many of the plots seen in the <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/news/functional-programming-principles-in-scala-impressions-and-statistics.html"><em>Functional Programming Principles in Scala: Impressions and Statistics</em></a> (Fall 2012) article on scala-lang.org. (Of course, adapted to the statistics gathered from the Fall 2013 iteration of the course).</p>

<p>We encourage you to checkout the repository, to generate the plots shown in the article yourself, and to explore the data further. Given sufficient interest, we plan on writing a follow-up article, and we'd love to hear from you! If you've found anything interesting in the data, or otherwise have a cool/interesting visualization to share, please don't hesitate to let us know! We'll include as many as we can in our follow-up article.</p>

<p>Pull requests are also welcome. Please either post in the comments <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/news/functional-programming-principles-in-scala-impressions-and-statistics.html">in the article</a> or contact <a href="http://people.epfl.ch/heather.miller">Heather</a> if need be.</p>

<a name="user-content-dependencies" class="anchor" href="#dependencies" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dependencies</h2>

<p>You need SBT 0.12 installed. If you don't already have SBT, <a href="https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Getting-Started-Setup">make sure to grab it</a>.</p>

<p>If you've got a mac, you can use either <a href="http://macports.org/">Macports</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo port install sbt
</code></pre>

<p>Or <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">HomeBrew</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew install sbt
</code></pre>

<p>For Linux users, you can use APT (other package managers are available on the getting started page)</p>

<pre><code>apt-get install sbt
</code></pre>

<p>Windows users can either install the <a href="http://scalasbt.artifactoryonline.com/scalasbt/sbt-native-packages/org/scala-sbt/sbt/0.12.0/sbt.msi">msi</a> or <a href="https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Getting-Started-Setup">create a batch file</a>.</p>

<a name="user-content-running" class="anchor" href="#running" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Running</h2>

<p>The code in this repository generates HTML/JavaScript visualizations of some of the data collected in the above survey.</p>

<p>To run,</p>

<ol class="task-list">
<li>Start SBT in the root directory of progfun-stats.</li>
<li><code>run</code></li>
<li>Select the plot that you wish to generate. Or select <code>ProgfunStats</code> to generate them all.</li>
<li>All HTML/JavaScript is generated in the html/ directory.</li>
</ol><h2>
<a name="user-content-explore-the-data-with-scala" class="anchor" href="#explore-the-data-with-scala" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Explore the data with Scala!</h2>

<p>To generate a new graph, define a new singleton object in <a href="https://github.com/heathermiller/progfun-stats/blob/master/src/main/scala/progfun/ProgfunStats.scala">ProgfunStats.scala</a>, and make sure to extend the proper <code>GraphFactory</code> (current choices are <code>GroupedBarGraphFactory</code>, <code>SimpleBarGraphFactory</code>, <code>PieChartFactory</code>, <code>WorldMapFactory</code>).</p>

<p>In all cases, there are a few fields that you need to implement-- for example, the <code>name</code> field, which corresponds to the name of the HTML file you wish to output, as well as the <code>data</code> field, which represents that data that you would like to display on a graph.</p>

<p>Have a look at the visualizations already implemented (the ones visible <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/news/functional-programming-principles-in-scala-impressions-and-statistics.html">in the article</a>) in <a href="https://github.com/heathermiller/progfun-stats/blob/master/src/main/scala/progfun/ProgfunStats.scala">ProgfunStats.scala</a></p>

<p>There are two ways to get to the data, depending on what you'd like to do with it. In general, all of the survey data lives in the <a href="https://github.com/heathermiller/progfun-stats/blob/master/src/main/scala/progfun/CourseraData.scala"><code>CourseraData</code></a> object. You can:</p>

<ol class="task-list">
<li>
<strong>Access entire rows of the dataset</strong>, <em>i.e.</em>, a single question answered by all respondents of the survey. For example, to see what all responses were for the question: "What's your highest degree?", you can simply <code>import CourseraData.degrees</code> (have a look at <a href="https://github.com/heathermiller/progfun-stats/blob/master/src/main/scala/progfun/CourseraData.scala"><code>CourseraData</code></a> to see all other possible options for import)</li>
<li>
<strong>Access all responses per respondent</strong>, <em>i.e.</em>, a list of <a href="https://github.com/heathermiller/progfun-stats/blob/master/src/main/scala/progfun/User.scala"><code>User</code></a>s, each has a field for each question asked in the survey (luckily no more than 22!). Simply <code>import CourseraData.users</code>.This is useful when you want to plot two qualities against each other. For example, in the <a href="https://github.com/heathermiller/progfun-stats/blob/master/src/main/scala/progfun/ProgfunStats.scala#L95">graph of perceived difficulty vs background/field</a> we need to know what a single user inputted for two different fields. That is, we needed to first filter out only Java/C/C++/FP experts, and then for those users, we needed to examine how difficult they believed the course to be.</li>
