<p>Saddle is a data manipulation library for Scala that provides array-backed,
indexed, one- and two-dimensional data structures that are judiciously
specialized on JVM primitives to avoid the overhead of boxing and unboxing.</p>

<p>Saddle offers vectorized numerical calculations, automatic alignment of data
along indices, robustness to missing (N/A) values, and facilities for I/O.</p>

<p>Saddle draws inspiration from several sources, among them the R programming
language &amp; statistical environment, the numpy and pandas Python libraries,
and the Scala collections library.</p>
