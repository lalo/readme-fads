<p>Before building and testing Quicksilver, <strong>ALWAYS BACKUP</strong> your user data!<br>
This is easily done by backing up the following 2 folders and preference file:</p>

<p>(<code>&lt;user&gt;</code> stands for your short user name):</p>

<p><code>/Users/&lt;user&gt;/Library/Application Support/Quicksilver</code><br><code>/Users/&lt;user&gt;/Library/Caches/Quicksilver</code><br><code>/Users/&lt;user&gt;/Library/Preferences/com.blacktree.Quicksilver.plist</code>  </p>

<p>Now if anything happens you can always restore the exact state Quicksilver was in before your were trying out this version. </p>

<p>Having multiple copies of Quicksilver.app on the system can cause issues with the Services System in OS X and AppleScript.</p>

<p>Specifically, Services will not register properly when the pasteboard server (<code>/System/Library/CoreServices/pbs</code>) sees multiple Quicksilver.app packages each with their own Info.plist file defining the same services. AppleScript will also get confused with more than one Quicksilver.app on your Mac.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that the Services System and AppleScript work correctly, zip any old Quicksilver.app packages you want to keep, so you only have one Quicksilver.app file on your filesystem. Also do not forget to empty your trash after you deleted the older Quicksilver.app packages.</p>
