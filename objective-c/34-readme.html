<h2>
<a name="user-content-tcp" class="anchor" href="#tcp" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TCP</h2>

<p><strong>GCDAsyncSocket</strong> and <strong>AsyncSocket</strong> are TCP/IP socket networking libraries. Here are the key features available in both:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><p>Native objective-c, fully self-contained in one class.<br><em>No need to muck around with sockets or streams. This class handles everything for you.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Full delegate support<br><em>Errors, connections, read completions, write completions, progress, and disconnections all result in a call to your delegate method.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Queued non-blocking reads and writes, with optional timeouts.<br><em>You tell it what to read or write, and it handles everything for you. Queueing, buffering, and searching for termination sequences within the stream - all handled for you automatically.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Automatic socket acceptance.<br><em>Spin up a server socket, tell it to accept connections, and it will call you with new instances of itself for each connection.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Support for TCP streams over IPv4 and IPv6.<br><em>Automatically connect to IPv4 or IPv6 hosts. Automatically accept incoming connections over both IPv4 and IPv6 with a single instance of this class. No more worrying about multiple sockets.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Support for TLS / SSL<br><em>Secure your socket with ease using just a single method call. Available for both client and server sockets.</em></p></li>
</ul><p><strong>GCDAsyncSocket</strong> is built atop Grand Central Dispatch:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><p>Fully GCD based and Thread-Safe<br><em>It runs entirely within its own GCD dispatch_queue, and is completely thread-safe. Further, the delegate methods are all invoked asynchronously onto a dispatch_queue of your choosing. This means parallel operation of your socket code, and your delegate/processing code.</em></p></li>
<li><p>The Latest Technology &amp; Performance Optimizations<br><em>Internally the library takes advantage of technologies such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kqueue">kqueue's</a> to limit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call">system calls</a> and optimize buffer allocations. In other words, peak performance.</em></p></li>
</ul><p><strong>AsyncSocket</strong> wraps CFSocket and CFStream:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Fully Run-loop based<br><em>Use it on the main thread or a worker thread. It plugs into the NSRunLoop with configurable modes.</em>
</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="user-content-udp" class="anchor" href="#udp" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>UDP</h2>

<p><strong>GCDAsyncUdpSocket</strong> and <strong>AsyncUdpSocket</strong> are UDP/IP socket networking libraries. Here are the key features available in both:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><p>Native objective-c, fully self-contained in one class.<br><em>No need to muck around with low-level sockets. This class handles everything for you.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Full delegate support.<br><em>Errors, send completions, receive completions, and disconnections all result in a call to your delegate method.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Queued non-blocking send and receive operations, with optional timeouts.<br><em>You tell it what to send or receive, and it handles everything for you. Queueing, buffering, waiting and checking errno - all handled for you automatically.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Support for IPv4 and IPv6.<br><em>Automatically send/recv using IPv4 and/or IPv6. No more worrying about multiple sockets.</em></p></li>
</ul><p><strong>GCDAsyncUdpSocket</strong> is built atop Grand Central Dispatch:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Fully GCD based and Thread-Safe<br><em>It runs entirely within its own GCD dispatch_queue, and is completely thread-safe.
