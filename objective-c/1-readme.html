<p>If you updated to this revision by accident (e.g. a git pull), you might want to switch back to the
version you had before (<code>git checkout cc672132ab</code>). </p>

<p>Three20 still compiles and seems to work on iOS6, so there's no immediate need to remove everything now. 
Still, as the library is not maintained anymore, it might be a good time to replace it.</p>

<p>Lots of Three20's helpers are not needed anymore, as they are now present right in iOS.
For other parts there are some really good replacement available. 
If you're searching for a full replacement, <a href="http://nimbuskit.info">NimbusKit</a> might help, they even provide a <a href="http://wiki.nimbuskit.info/Three20-Migration-Guide">migration guide</a>.</p>
