<div class="announce instapaper_body textile" data-path="README.textile" id="readme"><article class="markdown-body entry-content" itemprop="mainContentOfPage"><p>ASIHTTPRequest is an easy to use wrapper around the CFNetwork API that makes some of the more tedious aspects of communicating with web servers easier. It is written in Objective-C and works in both Mac OS X and iPhone applications.</p>
<p>It is suitable performing basic HTTP requests and interacting with REST-based services (GET / POST / PUT / DELETE). The included ASIFormDataRequest subclass makes it easy to submit POST data and files using multipart/form-data.</p>
<p>It provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>A straightforward interface for submitting data to and fetching data from webservers</li>
	<li>Download data to memory or directly to a file on disk</li>
	<li>Submit files on local drives as part of POST data, compatible with the HTML file input mechanism</li>
	<li>Stream request bodies directly from disk to the server, to conserve memory</li>
	<li>Resume for partial downloads</li>
	<li>Easy access to request and response HTTP headers</li>
	<li>Progress delegates (NSProgressIndicators and UIProgressViews) to show information about download AND upload progress</li>
	<li>Auto-magic management of upload and download progress indicators for operation queues</li>
	<li>Basic, Digest + NTLM authentication support, credentials are automatically re-used for the duration of a session, and can be stored for later in the Keychain.</li>
	<li>Cookie support</li>
	<li>[NEW] Requests can continue to run when your app moves to the background (iOS 4+)</li>
	<li>GZIP support for response data AND request bodies</li>
	<li>The included ASIDownloadCache class lets requests transparently cache responses, and allow requests for cached data to succeed even when there is no network available</li>
	<li>[NEW] ASIWebPageRequest – download complete webpages, including external resources like images and stylesheets. Pages of any size can be indefinitely cached, and displayed in a UIWebview / WebView even when you have no network connection.</li>
	<li>Easy to use support for Amazon S3 – no need to fiddle around signing requests yourself!</li>
	<li>Full support for Rackspace Cloud Files</li>
	<li>[NEW] Client certificates support</li>
	<li>Supports manual and auto-detected proxies, authenticating proxies, and PAC file auto-configuration. The built-in login dialog lets your iPhone application work transparently with authenticating proxies without any additional effort.</li>
	<li>Bandwidth throttling support</li>
	<li>Support for persistent connections</li>
	<li>Supports synchronous &amp; asynchronous requests</li>
	<li>Get notifications about changes in your request state via delegation or [NEW] blocks (Mac OS X 10.6, iOS 4 and above)</li>
	<li>Comes with a broad range of unit tests</li>
</ul><p>ASIHTTPRequest is compatible with Mac OS 10.5 or later, and iOS 3.0 or later.</p>
