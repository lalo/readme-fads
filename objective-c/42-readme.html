<p><strong>Important:</strong> Cheddar for iOS is no longer maintained by Nothing Magical. It has been <a href="http://sam.roon.io/parting-ways-with-cheddar">sold</a>. Going forward, Cheddar is no longe open source since the new owner has choosen to keep it private. This will remain as an archive of the previous version that was open source. Everything should still work. Thank you to everyone for your support as I built Cheddar. Seriously. Thank you.</p>

<hr><p><a href="http://cheddarapp.com/apps">Cheddar for iOS</a> is the universal iPhone and iPad application for <a href="http://cheddarapp.com">Cheddar</a>, a simple &amp; instant task manager.</p>

<p>This is open source since the app is free already. It is intended to be a source of sample code for everyone to benefit from. You can make cool apps that use Cheddar and I hopefully get more users because you built something awesome.</p>

<p>Also, if you want to help out and fix some bugs, I'll love you forever. Maybe you'll even get a shirt or something :)</p>
