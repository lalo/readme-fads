<a name="user-content-whats-mruby" class="anchor" href="#whats-mruby" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's mruby</h2>

<p>mruby is the lightweight implementation of the Ruby language complying to (part of)
the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=59579">ISO standard</a>.
Its syntax is Ruby 1.9 compatible.</p>

<p>mruby can be linked and embedded within your application.  We provide the interpreter program "mruby" and
the interactive mruby shell "mirb" as examples.  You can also compile Ruby programs into compiled byte code
using the mruby compiler "mrbc".  All those tools reside in the "bin" directory.  "mrbc" is also able to
generate compiled byte code in a C source file, see the "mrbtest" program under the "test" directory
for an example.</p>

<p>This achievement was sponsored by the Regional Innovation Creation R&amp;D Programs of
the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan.</p>

<a name="user-content-note-for-license" class="anchor" href="#note-for-license" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Note for License</h2>

<p>mruby has chosen a MIT License due to its permissive license allowing
developers to target various environments such as embedded systems.
However, the license requires the display of the copyright notice and license
information in manuals for instance. Doing so for big projects can be
complicated or troublesome.
This is why mruby has decided to display "mruby developers" as the copyright name
to make it simple conventionally.
In the future, mruby might ask you to distribute your new code
(that you will commit,) under the MIT License as a member of
"mruby developers" but contributors will keep their copyright.
(We did not intend for contributors to transfer or waive their copyrights,
 Actual copyright holder name (contributors) will be listed in the AUTHORS file.)</p>

<p>Please ask us if you want to distribute your code under another license.</p>
