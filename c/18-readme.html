<p>jq is a command-line JSON processor.</p>

<p>If you want to learn to use jq, read the documentation at
<a href="http://stedolan.github.io/jq">http://stedolan.github.io/jq</a>. This
documentation is generated from the docs/ folder of this repository.
You can also try it online at <a href="http://jqplay.org">jqplay.org</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to hack on jq, feel free, but be warned that its internals
are not well-documented at the moment. Bring a hard hat and a
shovel. Also, read the wiki: <a href="http://github.com/stedolan/jq/wiki">http://github.com/stedolan/jq/wiki</a></p>

<p>If you're building directly from the latest git, you'll need flex and
bison installed. To build, run:</p>

<pre><code>autoreconf -i
./configure
make -j8
make check
</code></pre>

<p>After make finishes, you'll be able to use <code>./jq</code>. You can also
install it using:</p>

<pre><code>sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>If you're not using the latest git version but instead building a
released tarball (available on the website), then you won't need to
run <code>autoreconf</code> (and shouldn't), and you won't need flex or bison.</p>

<p>To cross-compile for OS X and Windows, see docs/Rakefile's build task
and scripts/crosscompile.  You'll need a cross-compilation environment,
such as Mingw for cross-compiling for Windows.</p></article></div>
