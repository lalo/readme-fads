FAQ
===

Q: Why would you want to build a web application in C? Didn't that idea die out 
with CGI?

A: Good question. C is fast and fun, when you use well-tested code it can 
be secure too. It also has a low memory foot-print. The aim of the project is 
that all of the usual functionality that you have in other frameworks 
(cookie handling, session management, templating etc) will be implemented via 
loosly coupled components with clean APIs.

Build Instructions
==================

From within the project directory:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make

Deployment
==========

The examples are deployable via fastcgi.
