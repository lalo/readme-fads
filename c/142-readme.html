<a name="user-content-caveat" class="anchor" href="#caveat" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Caveat</h3>

<p>This is pre-release software.  Only install it in a system that
you are ready to lose.  It is a good idea to make a virtual
machine (or three) to play around with Cockpit.</p>

<p>Cockpit is not yet ready for actual use, that's why there aren't any
installation instructions.  But if you want to play with the code,
please see the <code>HACKING.md</code> file.</p></article></div>
