<p>Hydra has been taken down, because it's not quite ready yet, and was released prematurely.</p>

<p>Current efforts are focused on making Hydra more modularized, by extracting all its functionality into opt-in extensions.</p>

<p>Also, because of trademark issues, Hydra is being renamed to Mjolnir.</p>
